Compared to the X that this would be replacing, it seemed like a very mild update, and not worth the entry price! However on actual use of this phone, it just shows that all the little improvements taken TOGETHER add up to a brilliant update. First off this just seems much quicker in use, from FaceID unlock to opening apps and swiping, there is no hesitation. I went for the new Forest Green colour also, which is also very nice. The phone feels nice in the hand. Now for the camera:The main reason for upgrading! Just wow! I know other smart phone manufacturers all have great cameras on their flagship phones but again, in use these new cameras and sensors and software on the iPhone 11 Pro, are incredible for taking great photos quickly and easily. The super-wide lens- 13mm (35mm equiv) is great for landscapes and interiors. And the normal (26mm) and \"telephoto\" lens (only 56mm I think) are very sharp and great for taking portraits in \"portrait mode\" where it blurs the background nicely.The effect can be altered post capture amongst many other things in the iPhone camera software. The selfie camera is also updated to 12 MP so much sharper than before. The \"Night Mode\" feature is truly black magic! With only minimal light, this tiny camera/phone that fits in your pocket can take photos at night that it almost makes it look as if taken in day light and is full of crisp detail. Incredible.In a few years there will not be much point in owning \"proper cameras!\" looking at the rate of progression of these smart phone cameras. And oh yes, you can make great phone calls on this device as well as all the other things we take for granted now (internet browsing, social media, online banking which is the most secure on the iPhone).

At first , i decided to get the iPhone 11, but truly, i would have regretted that decision. Bought this finally. I have been using this device for a few days now, and i am writing a review based on what i feel. nnAt first, Getting the device on hand made me feel it\u2019s kind of a bit heavy than the old iPhone 8 plus or the Xs Max. The look and design of the phone gives a premium feel in hand.  The display is awesome, and so is the screen resolution. The three camera module captures fantastic images, and it is great for wide angle photography. Speaking of camera, i have noticed, the camera holds the color of the images both in wide angle or telephoto shots, which doesnt seem to happen with other devices.nnNot to mention, the night mode of the iPhone 11 pro max has been drastically improved and it really clicks great images in low light conditions which is impressive! The iOS 13 adds butter to the phone\u2019s UI. Performance wise, there is no issues which i have faced using iPhones these years. The A13 Bionic chip is super efficient and really consumes battery intelligently. nnI think the phone is little over priced, but its okay when you want to have such a premium device in hand. nI\u2019m satisfied with the performance it provides, and I\u2019m completely fit in Apple\u2019s eco system. nnHope this review helps,nnThank you.. \ud83d\ude01", "2 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "17 Oct 2019,"], ["had to sell my kidney but you gotta do, what you gotta do!", "2 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "06 Oct 2019,"], ["Great photos", "2 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "04 Oct 2019,"], ["Better experience than Andriod, but some things need to be changed.
