QUICK REVIEW1.DISPLAY- It comes with a 6.30-inch IPS LCD multi-touch touchscreen display with a resolution of 1080x2280 pixels & an aspect ratio of 19.5:9.Display is good in this price range.2.PROCESSOR- It is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor.I think in this price range this is the best feature of this phone.3.CAMERA- BACK CAMERA  - 48MP + 8MP(ultra wide lens) +2MP(macro lens) + 2MP(depth sensor)  FRONT CAMERA - 13 MP Selfie Camera (without flash)Camera is awesome but i think front camera could be better ,it was expecting 20 megapixel camera.4.SOFTWARE & BATTERY- It runs MIUI 10 based on Android 9 Pie & is powered by a 4000mAh Battery Capacity + 18W Fast Charger.But I dont like MIUI Ads.5.STORAGE- It packs 64GB of inbuilt storage that can be expanded via microSD card (up to 512GB) with a dedicated slot.6.SIM- It comes with Dual SIM Support (nano+nano) & Dual-standby (4G+4G)7.PROTECTION- Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back and P2i splash-proof nano coating .I like the protection and design of this phone.8.CONNECTIVITY- It has Wi-Fi 802.11, GPS ,3.5mm audio socket,speaker on the bottom and USB Type-C.9.SENSORS- It includes accelerometer, ambient light sensor, compass/ magnetometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, and fingerprint sensor.10.BIOMETRIC AUTHETICATION- It supports AI Face Unlock & Fingerprint Unlock.11.VIDEO- It Supports 4K UHD Video recording .12.SIZE AND WEIGHT- The Redmi Note 8 measures 158.30 x 75.30 x 8.35mm (height x width x thickness) and weighs 188.00 grams.It is very comfortable to handle from one hand.13.DESIGN-Aura Fluid Design at back with U Notch Screen.14.OTHER FEATURES- Has IR Blaster, Notification Lights and Wireless FM with Recording Feature.    DETAILED REVIEW    PROS       1.CAMERARedmi Note 8 on the rear has a 48MP primary camera (f/1.79 aperture)+ 8-megapixel camera (f/2.2 aperture,ultra wide lens)+ 2MP camera (f/2.4 aperture,macro lens)) + 2MP camera (f/2.4 aperture,depth sensor). The rear camera setup has autofocus.Remember they are not sony lenses.Their is also portrait mode,night mode and panaroma Mode.On the front it has 13 MP Selfie Camera (f/2.0,). I think front camera could be better,as i was expecting 25MP Front Camera,Colour reproduction in photos is very good,it looks natural and  not over saturated. In inddoor conditions photos are good but not that great when compared to outdoor shots,but in this price range it is awesome.   2.PROTECTIONIt looks premium. It looks classy.The credit for the premium design of the Note 8 goes to dual Gorilla Glass 5 protection and Aura Design that Xiaomi is using for a while in its phones.Gorilla Glass 5 protection on front and back is good addition as it saves phone from breakage after fall.Also it has splash proof coating,i think in this price segment getting these safety features makes this phone different from others.   3.PROCESSORIn this price range Snapdragon 665 processor  makes this phone unique ,it is very fast and one can do multitasking easily and it didnt heat up quickly.   4.BATTERYWhat i love about this phone is its fast charging support and 18W fast charger comes in the box.Dual 4G Standby (4G+4G) and 64gb storage is great addition   5.PHONE WEIGHTWeight is relatively manageable at 188g, and this phone is 8.35mm thick. It's comfortable enough to hold in one hand and use.    CONS       1.GAMING EXPERIENCEIt Gets warm while Playing High End Games at high graphic settings otherwise gaming experience was awesome.   2.Finger print ScannerFingerprint sensor is not that fast,though it is not an issue but it is little bit slow.Face Unlock takes less time and is very accurate.   3.BloatwaresMIUI 10 has a lot of bloatware which i think Xiaomi should work .    CONCLUSIONUNDER 10K ,It is steal deal,what i loved is its camera ,processor ,corning glass 5 protection & fast charging.what i dont like it lags while Playing High End Games like PUBG even at medium graphic settings.But under 10K it is better than any phone ,so i will say go for it without any doubts.

It's just amazing. My review will primarily be focused on how does Mi A3 stack up against Mi A2 since I've been using the Mi A2 since last 8+ months.Mi A3 does a great job at the exterior, be it finishing or the dimensions ... just perfect. Mi A2 was slightly big in terms of width as well as height but Mi A3 cuts a few millimeters from both width and height and makes it more manageable to use the phone with one hand.CPU is just fine, not a very big upgrade from Mi A2 but the battery has certainly increased and that's evident while using the phone. Mi A3 does last more than a day if you are an above average user.Camera is great, tried Gcam mod and it performs even better. The camera bump doesn't trouble me now as it did in Mi A2. It supports QC 3.0 but I'm yet to see results on a QC 3.0 certified charger.Now, let's talk about the display ... yes, the one thing that's making buzz even before the phone launched and all the buzz, concerns are true. The display isn't that good and you can see pixels on the display. Now, that's something that bummed me a big time. I didn't give a damn on how powerful the CPU is but it's a Super AMOLED display with HD+ resolution in which I can clearly see the pixels. Also, the screen isn't bright enough and appealing. When I use both Mi A2 and A3 simultaneously, I am so disappointed when I look at Mi A3's screen after looking at Mi A2's screen.The phone is really well priced if you're not looking at a high performer smartphone. But, only for the display, I am in shock as to why I bought this phone. I guess, I'll just have to learn to live with it and as time progresses, I might start liking the display.My rating: 3.75 / 5P.S. I'll update the review after extensive usage and testing along with pictures later. Until then, my suggestion would be, use the phone in person, if you're okay with the display, go for it, else skip this one.

I have bought Mi Y3 phone (for my dad) after his older Mi phone got battery and internet connectivity issues after using it for about 3 years.My current Mi Y3 phone review is as under:Pros:1 Best budget phone with good storage capacity.2 Good touch screen and color resolution.3 User friendly and simple to understand.4 Camera quality is superb. The selfie camera is a star feature in this phone as advertised. And also the back camera quality is also very good. Finally I am satisfied with mi phone camera quality!      4 Mi phones in general does not get hang like other brand smart phones (such as samsung, oppo, vivo and others) while playing high end games, watching youtube videos, checking mails, facebook, instagram using internet access.5 Most important- Mi phones are mostly durable and lasts long... until you get bored of it. Just make sure to drop it less often, use original Mi charger and Mi cable to charge. Avoid charging through car chargers and power banks to keep battery life good.Cons:1 Although Mi phones claim to give good battery life, but the battery drains quickly when we actually use internet connection with it.2 The exterior phone quality is OK... not as impressive as mi phones available for 15k or above. I guess mostly because it is budget phone.Verdict:Would definitely suggest to buy if you are looking for a good budget phone with good selfie camera, playing high end internet games, using Facebook, Instagram or YouTube. You won't regret!      But still if you can extend your budget to 15k -17k, would suggest to go for other mi phone such as Redmi note 7 Pro with good back camera and better phone exterior.If you find my review helpful, please click the YES/HELPFUL button!

RAM management is very good, I compared against some other phones, I can say Samsung has done a very good job. I an not seeing applications getting reloaded.5. Camera output is pretty sharp, images are pretty good.6. Battery life is great, It easily lasts one day with 100% charge. And the rate of charging is pretty good.Dislikes:1. Phone isn't very responsive, if you search anything in settings app, for the first time it usually takes more than 3 seconds to search.2. We can easily notice lagginess in the app switch animation. I have even tried stopping all animations to check the responsiveness, but it didn't help.3. Speaker output is ain't great but we can manage.4. In past week I have seen screen freezing issue a few times. All of a sudden facerecognition animation started showing at the bottom of the screen.5. Biggest disappointment is fingerprint scanner, most of the times it won't work. Whenever it works, it takes its own time(and it ain't consistent). I personally got frustrated with this unlocking mechanism, I switched to face and pattern recognition. I would have been happy if they had provided capacitive fingerprint scanner. Even after the recent update, it didn't help much, yes, now the rate of successful detection is high but still fails most of the times.To conclude,I was using MI 5(with Sd820) and it lasted for 3 years. I wanted another budget phone which can last 3 years(I don't wanted to buy mi), so went ahead with Samsung, but looking at it's performance i can say it won't last for 3 years.

In the past I have used Motorolas exclusively. I 'was' a big Motorola fan and consider stock android as the best user experience on a smartphone.Pros1. Display 5/5     Big, Beautiful but more importantly a well-calibrated one. It's easily better than the Oppo and Vivo AMOLED implementations, simply because Samsung has taken the pains to somehow calibrate each unit.2. Ergonomics 5/5     You are unlikely to call this device bulky or cumbersome for one-handed use because of the 20:9 aspect ratio, excellent weight management and OneUI optimisations for one-handed use.3. Battery Life 4/5     11-12hrs SoT for me i.e. 1.5days use. Frankly, it's a bit disappointing considering that my older Motorolas gave 6-8hrs on 13nm architecture SoCs, had 2,700-3,000 mah batteries and had less efficient LCD panels. At 6,000mah it should've given close to 14hr SoT, for my use-case.4. Performance 5/5     Very fast app opening speeds! Compares very well with the Snapdragon 821 powered and phenomenally well optimized OnePlus 3T. Falls short of the Asus 5z, which is a no-brainer. RAM management is decent too, of the 4GB RAM I tend to have 1.5GB free. 8-10 non-game apps are typically always in memory. UFS 2.1 is a Big leap for those of us upgrading from eMMC storage. This is particularly noticeable in both app opening speeds as well as in the gallery app where Images and Video thumbnails load instantly. Deleting is also super fast!5. Touch Response 5/5     Fast, precise, with low latency. Particularly noticeable on the keyboard, quick toggle menu, as well as when knocking off notifications or deleting feeds on say, the Chrome browser. Faster animations further this experience.6. One UI 3.5/5     It's difficult to rate it because I've ALWAYS used stock android. And although I enjoy the add-ons OneUI comes with I also miss the clean, fluid, conflict-free experience that stock android is known for. Mind you, this is FAR better than the Chinese ROMs that I tried out in offline stores; ColorOS, FuntouchOS, MIUI and even ZenUI. OneUI is less obtrusive, cleaner, has no ads and is easier to use one-handed. OneUI isn't flawless, I have experienced app crashes (Tata Sky and Palabre) on when I never faced any issues with them with my previous phones. It does ship with bloatware, asks for a LOT of permissions, has unrequired 'suggestions'. Though all of that can be shut down within 5mins. What you do have to put up with is     stutters. You see them from time to time. It may not be a deal breaker, but yes  it's clearly a step-down from stock android. For me, if Stock android is 100... Oxygen OS gets a 100 too, One UI gets 85 and ZenUI gets 75. The other Chinese skins (MIUI, ColorOS, FuntouchOS) are definitely far more heavily modified and further away from the core experience android is known for.7. Call Quality and Cellular Reception 5/5     I actually placed calls from all the weak spots at home where signals drop to just 1 bar. Thankfully the M30s doesn't drop signals more than other phones that I've used in fact it's a shade better than the Motorolas I had previously. It's not a mind-blowing signal-catcher either, but yes I do get internet on my Jio sim where sometimes the other phones would struggle. Call quality was Good too, slightly better than the 5z but just short of the OnePlus 3T. Compared to 5z, the sound is sharper (but never sibilant) as opposed to being slightly more muffled and recessed in the upper frequencies.8. Reliability/Peace of mind and a vast Service network.Cons1. Build quality 3/5     Its a unibody plastic build but a rather flimsy grade of plastic has been used. You can feel and at times also hear the plastic flex next to the power button and the fingerprint scanner. The button themselves have a short travel and satisfactory tactility. Most Chinese phones (which I checked out at offline stores) offer a better build and have Gorilla Glass too, which is rated higher than Schott or Asahi's dragontail (used here), especially in terms of drop protection. For scratch resistance this should be ok, hopefully.2. Charging performance 2/5     2hrs 30mins is very 2015 (6,000 mah, I know). Perhaps an 18w charger helps shave off 15mins or so?, I'll give an update on that. What's more irksome is that if you are using the phone while charging it significantly slows down charging speed (3.5hrs or so!), this is a difference you can't miss. It does not happen on the other devices I have at home, to this extent.3. Cameras 2/5     I've used SLRs/DSLRs for over 2 decades so I understand a thing or two. Which also means I don't expect phones, especially at this price point to do great. Even with toned down expectations the cameras are rather poor. The '48mp' Detail is absent, dynamic range mediocre and there's over sharpening/ringing too, though colours are thankfully more natural than I expected from Samsung. Frankly, the '48mp', '64mp', '108mp' number dropping these days is wayyy deep into gimmicky territory because these things at best may be a tad better than older 12/16mp modules, when implemented right. I can only say that it's nowhere near the 12mp primary camera on the Asus 5z (especially with gCam, at night). What's good is the Video Stability & super slow motion feature. Stabilization is actually better than the other two, especially surprising if you know that both 5z & 3t have OIS, this does not! I will update this section if/when I can compare it against its class.4. LTE speeds over Jio 2.5/5     A bit disappointing actually. Here it's more like the 6-series from 2018. Even with UFS 2.1, app downloading over Jio was very similar to the older phones I've used. Nowhere close to the 3t, leave alone 5z. Mind you, the Snapdragon 7-series is FAR closer to the 835/845 on this category.5. Heapdhone quality 3/5     I'm not a hardcore audiophile but I've spent a small fortune on audio over the years. The m30s has a lively presentation with good dynamics and respectable detail but the frequency response isn't flat. The bass is clearly boosted and the upper frequencies are muted. Its definitely a flavoured sound unlike my Moto G5 Plus which had phenomenally clean audio and superb stereo separation (price no bar!), with my Audio Technica ath-m50, Soundmagic e10c and Beyerdynamic Byron I never had a complaint. The M30s has better detail for sure but it's a more central ('in your head'), less neutral sound. The Hidizs Sonata HD is a good option if you want a solid upgrade for around 2-2.5k, if you want to go cheaper still try the pixel Type-C to 3.5mm dongle there's a lot of praise for it and it's available for just 1.3k or so.6. Lack of XDA love     The XDA community showers tons of love to Snapdragon powered phones in making them cleaner/slicker/customizable with Custom ROMs because Exynos is locked out by Samsung :(7. Speaker performance     Not bad but certainly nothing above mediocre. At least it's not that ear piercing, shrill sound that some models at this price point are plagued with and its loud too. OnePlus 3T has a significantly cleaner, tighter output. I won't even bother drawing a comparison with the 5z ;)8. Android Update track record     I found that Samsung has one of the slowest update speeds, 6-10 months after official release (if you're lucky!). Which probably means no Android 10 until March 2020 :( May be things change in the OneUI era?First impressions, a full 5/5.I'll update with Long-term findings.--- 7th October, 2019. 1-week update ---One UI experience.So I've begun to appreciate OneUI in its entirety. The stutters have reduced, I guess when the phone was new there was a lot happening in the background. Besides, some of the intrusive stuff was still running which I've since force stopped and disabled.The features that I think are great additions over stock android...1. Open in pop-up view     True multitasking! A huge plus in my book.2. Always on display     A great feature to have on an AMOLED display and a 6,000mah battery.3. The screenshot toolbar     it's well designed and the added functionality is much appreciated.4. Gesture based quick app switcher     A neat and well implemented way of quickly moving through apps5. 9-band Equaliser     The presets and the fully customizable graphic equaliser have system wide effect over audio, a very underrated feature.6. Dark/Night mode     Android 10 will bring this at the system level. But it doesn't hurt to have it at some level already, even if its only for the system apps.What I think are half-baked or unrequired features...1. Aggressive auto brightness     The ambient light sensor almost always chooses a brighter than required output.2. Assistive touch     2 pages to swipe through is a good idea but most of it is of absolutely no use! And there's no option to customise it either.3. Screenshot shortcuts     They've given 3 bad ways of doing it. And the award for the worst experience goes to... \"Palm swipe\"! Not only is it inconsistent but also senselessly cumbersome. 3-finger swipe on my Motorola worked flawlessly and was faster too. I tried the Assistive touch but that always-on-screen button soon became an eyesore. So I ended up with the Power button + Volume down key :(All my other 'first impressions' remain unchanged.A piece of advice for prospective buyers:If the negative reviews confuse you, please understand this     The negative reviews are by people who have either...1. Bought the device for the wrong reasons.2. Or have unrealistic expectations from a device that was available under 12k, at launch.3. Or have a genuine issue with a bad unit (a very small percentage).4. Or are paid trolls!Most of the negative reviews seem to fall in category 1. & 2.The USPs of this device are...1. A Very Very good display     It's accurate, most cheap AMOLED sporting devices are not. Which is why you get unnatural skin tones and unrealistic greens/reds with some other mid-range phones (Mi A3, Realme XT, Vivo z1x etc.)2. One UI     A FAR cleaner alternative to Chinese skins/ROMs3. Excellent battery life     11/12hrs of SoT!4. Fast app opening speeds and RAM management5. Reliability!I ordered a case but it hasn't been delivered yet.Despite that there's not one scratch on the display or the back!You will be disappointed if you are buying this device particularly for...1. Build quality2. or Camera performance3. or Charging speed4. or Superfast updates5. or for making NFC payments (via Google pay or Samsung pay). Though not many outlets accept this in India, at least not in Tier 2 cities, as of 2019.Also remember that all other alternatives will come with their own set of drawbacks too.Can't have it all, not in 2019 at least.Rating unchanged, fully satisfied \"for the price paid!\"           ", "135 users found this review helpful"], ["This is not orginal phone this is made in india and not upto the mark as samsung . camera is not good quality and not mark upto 48MP  and battery is not good           ", "130 users found this review helpful"], ["Good Product and amazing fast delivery by Amazon within 2 hour only           ", "126 users found this review helpful"], ["Received M30s today and really  a great buy .

I've heard people complaining  about creaking noises in the back panel, but personally, I haven't noticed any such thing. I even tried pressing the back panel hard to just see, but it seemed  pretty  solid to me. Apart from that, the battery is obviously  outstanding and so is the display. The UI is smooth and snappy as well, no lag noticed. However, I am not a gamer, so I don't know how would that turn out.Overall, I think if you can settle in the camera area a bit, it's a great deal, considering you also get Samsung's  excellent  after sales experience and support.

Another issue is service centre very bad experienced i ever had. Within 2 month vooc charge has some problem. Not charging at vooc speed. And cant able to connect to laptop. I went to service centre they analysed for 2 hrs and said phone strip and cable have some issue and i asked them to replace it. They want me to handover my mobile and wait for 5 to 6 working days. Now i have warrent i will claim. After 6 month the same problem persist we need to pay money for the issue to solve.  I analised the following cases today while waiting in service centre.. for 9/10 issues many of them are realme users. Follwing issues came* Realme xt finger print and password not working just swipe up it will open.( This both realme xt are only a 2 days mobile)* Another realme xt user came that his mobil brightness  reaches zero at ni8 and had a bad experience.*Realme c2 user had automatic turn off and on issue* Another realme user came i walked out after taken my mobile back.So think twice before buying realme. Or go to netest realme service centre and just analyse how many realme users vist the shop daily. Dont just fall into trap.. they are arousing our desire and making us to buy.. all review ratings are above 4 and 5 i think its not genuine. This was my experience.

The Realme C2 starts at Rs. 5,999 .It's good in battery life , software,design and bad because it's performance is weak.Realme C2 has set new records as they have launched the best phone for just 6K.when Xiaomi was the only brand for beginners range but now Realme has come in the market to compete with them.Realme C2 is a complete and a great device for normal gamers but great entertainers and Realme C2 is a heavily configured phone with money-value.But there are some drawbacks so we talk about that1.The phone has a delicate plastic body which makes it a bit fragile and more prone to accidental damages. So you have to very cautious while handling it.2.The phone lacks a Fingerprint sensor .3.you cannot enjoy had videos in this smartphone.4.Cameras are average and do not perform as per expectations in low light and indoor lighting condition.Overall, the photos are respectable for a budget phone camera but don   t expect much.If you   re a clean and minimal stock android lover, then the plenty of features and apps might overwhelm you.the phone has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a lone speaker grill at the bottom, power button to the right and volume rockers to the left alongside the SIM tray. The buttons are tactile, the headphone and speaker output are more than okay at this budget.The phone   s decent display with fair color accuracy leaves us wishing it were a bit brighter tooThe Realme C2 is definitely a device you should go for as it delivers great performance and features. The most satisfying thing is its price that will wow your mind.We are gonna see how the Realme C2 holds up against the competition and why should you select it over other phones.

Thankfully, VIVO launched a phone which not only had these qualities but many more. I am hooked on to games and movies. With a 6.35 inch display, the VIVO U10 has made my experience of watching movies and playing games much more rewarding. The quality of the camera and the battery life are really awesome. The best part, at Rs 9,990, the phone is easy on the pocket. Though I am quite satisfied with the phone but the only concern is that it takes too long for the phone to charge. Otherwise, the VIVO U10 is worth the money.           ", "2 users found this review helpful"], ["My previous redmi note 4 was totally broken and I needed a balanced performing phone well within a budget.Vivo U10 has got everything that I was looking for specifically good camera and battery.Design & Display-    The U10 has a premium body design with a glossy dual tone effect, which is one of the highlights of the device.    It Comes in 2 beautiful colors.    It stands out from the crowd as it looks really cool and futuristic.    The screen to body ratio is 89%.    The phone has glass back panel and with the halo full view display the bezels are at minimum.    It feels quite premium in hand.    It has a triple card slot and dual 4G sim slots.    Another coolest thing about the phone is the On-Screen Sound Technology, which transforms the whole screen into a speaker and thereby increasing the screen to body ratio.Performance-    It comes with the Snapdragon 665 processor with ultra gaming mode for gamers.    The phone is capable of handling multitasking as well as day-to-day tasks.    The battery will easily last two days with moderate to heavy usage.    On a daily basis, I watched videos, played games, using social media, messaging apps, making calls as well as listened to music online.    PUBG on the phone is really amazing and fast. The default setting is HD graphics and high frame rate which works flawlessly.    The storage is expandable up to 512GB.Camera-    It has one of the best cameras in the budget range.It houses three cameras on the back panel and a single image sensor on the front for selfies. On the back panel, the it includes a primary 13MP sensor, 8MP wide-angle lens and third is a 2MP depth sensor that helps in clicking portrait or pictures with blurred background. Inside the teardrop notch, the Vivo U10 includes an 8MP selfie shooter.    I'm impressed by the camera quality at this price range.    I   m waiting to add google camera and see the results.Operating System-    It's coming with Funtouch OS 9 with Android Version 9 Pie.    I personally like the look and feel of the OS which is simple and smooth.Battery-    It comes with a 5000mAH lithium-ion battery.    It supports Fast charging.    Comes with 18W micro USB Fast charger.Other Points-    Fingerprint Scanner and Face Unlock works flawlessly.    It Comes with a clear soft cover and the quality is really good.    It Comes with all necessary sensors like Accelerometer, Fingerprint Sensor, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Hall Sensor, Proximity Sensor, Virtual Light Sensing.Overall Verdict-    The U10 features a Halo display, unique design, good performance, good battery life, a triple card slot, and a competitive price which makes it the best smartphone in the 10K range.    The value for money pricing can give a tight competition to Xiaomi and other phones in this price range.

Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.           ", "8 users found this review helpful"], ["Everything is good in phone like camera and display.

This means it does feel somewhat dated, especially when placed down next to  Samsung's Galaxy S8, although those fond of Apple's go-to design unlikely will have any complaints.         This dated feel is largely down to the  chunky bezels that surround  the 4.7in screen, with Apple's rivals - and even Apple itself - making the move towards full-screen, bezel-free devices. This does mean that there's room for Apple's trusty Touch ID sensor underneath the display, though, which has so far worked flawlessly every time.       Like the  iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 is waterproof too, thanks to the handset's IP67 certification which means, in theory, it should withstand being dunked into water up to 1 metre for 30 minutes. This has rung true for us so far, but we  try and avoid getting the handset too wet given its exposed ports on the bottom.         The iPhone 8 is a tad heavier than last year's iPhone 7 at 148g, which we found made it feel more robust. It apparently is, according to Apple, which boasts that the glass on the phone's rear is the \"most durable glass ever on an iPhone.\" We haven't managed to drop our iPhone 8 yet, but it feels like it could withstand a tumble or two.       Elsewhere on the handset you'll find the Lightning port on the bottom edge is flanked by a speaker and microphone, and there's nothing up top. There's no return for the 3.5mm audio jack, but Apple includes a Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter in the box.       There's also updated stereo speakers, which make the phone around 25 percent louder than the iPhone 7.       DISPLAY:    The iPhone 8's display is largely identical to the iPhone 7. And the 6S, and, er, the iPhone 6. This means that the 4.7in screen, with its 1,334x750 resolution, does feel somewhat  old-fashioned, not to mention small, compared to the likes of the Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2, again, added to by the bezels that surround it. Quality wise, while it pales against its rivals on paper, we've no complaints, and it continues to be among the sharpest and most vibrant on the market.       The only real change to the iPhone 8's screen is the addition of Apple's True-Tone technology that first debuted on the 9.7in iPad Pro.  This True Tone alters the colour temperature of the display depending on the environment in which you're in, reducing the harsh blue tones typical of an LCD when you're in a  dimly lit room.       PERFORMANCE:    Apple's new A11 Bionic chip sits under the hood of the iPhone 8 and, as expected, it's incredibly fast.       Specs-wise, the six-core CPU comprises of two low-performance cores and four high-performance cores, with the regular cores being 25 per cent faster than the previous A10 chip, and the high-performance cores being up to 75 per cent faster than the A10 SoC, according to Apple It also comes paired with Apple's first homegrown GPU, which offers 30 per cent more performance than the A10.       SOFTWARE:    The iPhone 8 ships with iOS 11, naturally, which brings  with it improvements to Siri, reworked lock screen notifications, a new-look Control Centre and Apple's redesigned App Store.       CAMERA:    On paper,  the main camera on the iPhone 8 is no different to that found on the iPhone 7, with Apple retaining the same 12MP sensor with built-in f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilisation (OIS).       The biggest changes come on the video side of things with 4K recording now available at 60fps and slo-mo video now 1080p at 240fps - both of which are double the iPhone 7 and the former is a first for any smartphone.       I tried it out in a variety of different lighting conditions, indoor and out, and  were impressed with the camera's capabilities - in particular when low lighting is involved, something our iPhone 8 struggled to cope with. This is aided by the always-on HDR, which increases saturation while retaining more natural and realistic colours than images shot on the Note 8, for example.         The biggest changes are seen on the video side,  with 4K recording now available at 60fps and slo-mo video now 1080p at 240fps - double what the iPhone 7 has on offer.       On the front of the phone you'll find a 7MP camera f/2.2 aperture, Retina Flash and 1080p video recording,  and while this isn't as great in low-light as the rear-facing snapper, it's perfectly good enough for the occasional selfie and Snapchatting, or whatever it is you kids get up to. Unfortunately, however, you don't get Apple's new Portrait Mode on the iPhone 8, nor the new Portrait Lighting feature that the iPhone 8 Plus has.       BATTERY LIFE:    According to Apple, the battery inside the iPhone 8 will  last around two hours longer than the iPhone 7's, despite weighing in slightly smaller at  1,821mAh.This has proved accurate during my time with the iPhone 8 so far. It usually gets me to the end of the day - just, whereas I usually had to charge my iPhone 8 most evenings.       It's much less of a hassle to charge the iPhone 8 too, as it - along with the iPhone X - is Apple's first smartphone to support wireless charging. What's more, whereas Apple usually requires expensive propriety accessories, the iPhone 8 supports the Qi wireless charging standard, which means it'll work with most third-party charges on the market.         VERDICT:    In short the iPhone 8 is an excellent phone and there are some great new editions to get excited about, such as the inclusion of wireless charging for the first time and Apple's new A11 Bionic CPU, which is benchmarks are anything to go by, is the fastest mobile CPU on the market right now.         Beyond that, though, the iPhone 8 is an incremental update over last year's iPhone 7, and its large bezels and three-year-old design mean it does feel somewhat dated compared to the likes of the Galaxy S8 and Pixel XL 2, despite carrying a similarly-expensive price-tag.

I play PUBG n COD 2-3 hours everyday. I charge once a day.3) 90Hz speed is definitely noticeable while surfing or using apps4) 855+ chipset with Adreno 640 is currently the best available combination for high end mobiles.5) I did benchmarking for my phone to know it's peak performance, how much max temp it will reach, max FPS etc I'll attach the photo here6) Can play any games available at play store at Max graphics but this will heatup the phone.Cons1) They should definitely work on camera. When I click photo's with my phone it gives decent ones but not upto the mark compared to Note 10+ or Pixel.2) Phone do get heatup while playing games. Sometimes due to its glass back i can feel it's getting really hot. It will reach around 47 degrees3) You cannot rely on the case which OnePlus provides. You need to buy military grade protection case. If you drop it from more than 4 feet, it's glass back or screen will be shattered. You can watch it on YouTube4) Cheap trick from OnePlus is that they have removed headphone jack and anyone who want to use wired headphones, need to buy connector from their website it will cost 390 + 49 delivery fee.Did notice screen flickering while charging but it went away on it's own.This is my view on the phone                  ", "248 users found this review helpful"], ["Best           ", "96 users found this review helpful"], ["Its fastest phone that I have ever experienced.

It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ====I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below.OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro.===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ====+ Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus.+ Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance.+ Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T.+ Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology.+ Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro)+ Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.==== What's in the Box? ====OnePlus 7T Pro Device.User Manual.Transparent Silicon Case.SIM Ejector Tool.Warp 30T Charging Brick.Type C USB Cable.And some cool OnePlus Stickers.==== Display ====Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday.==== Camera ====I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too.==== Video ====If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro.==== Software ====This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.==== Battery ====Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage.==== What could've been improved ====- Minor improvements on Camera.- No ToF sensor- No Wireless Charging.- IP Rating.- Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades.==== Verdict ====No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box.If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck.If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.

Where does 6T lacks?:- Under Display Fingerprint Scanner, Lack of 3.5 Headphone Jack.Now Cameras:Still Photography in Daylight: Redmi Note 7 Pro's photos are sharper, has more details than OP6T and colours are better more true to life, probably it's due to Sony IMX 586 Exmor RS Sensor.Nightlife Photography: RN7Pro and OP6T both capture almost same Nightmode photos with GCam and Stock Camera, despite having OIS in OP6T.Selfie: Poco F1 selfies are a little bit better than OP6T and RN7PRO.Videography: 4K 60fps with decent stabilization and slow-motion OP6T records better videos.Conclusion: At    31,499 OnePlus 6T great/super value for money smartphone mainly due to it's UI Oxygen OS and Display.

It got multiple issues with it like bloatware, frequent adds, average audio streaming quality and frequent WiFi disconnects ( it switches between my 2.4 and 5Ghz WiFi network thus dropping the connection).

This size ( 5.85 inch) is perfect. I found it to be perfect, it's handy and you easily use it with one hand.3. Display is crisp and very good. It's got notch display as well however some may not like the notch.4. Cellular reception is good and voice clarity is good.5. Bluetooth audio streaming is excellent. I got premium Bluetooth speakers like Marshall, Bose and the audio streaming quality is far better than my Redmi note 6.6. Install Google camera and the results are amazing. Try it and see the difference. The default camera app is not good. What this means is that Nokia got good quality sensors and hardware.7. Apps run smoothly, no lag or crash.

The camera has tons of modes and a very customizable manual mode.The UI needs a little getting used to from a stock android user perspective.  The voice call quality for both the acoustic display and the microphone are very good.Gaming is a blast, I could game for 3hours of Pubg before the phone needing a recharge.

Honor calls its approach FullView, which basically refers to devices with a higher screen-to-device ratio.Honor 9 Lite     ScreenMaking the front of your phone even more about the display than usual places extra pressure on the quality of the screen itself. Thankfully, the Honor 9 Lite isn   t found wanting in this respect.This is a nicely sized 5.65-inch IPS LCD screen, with decent viewing angles, contrast and strong brightness when you need to crank things up. You   d need to spend considerably more money to find something much better. Meanwhile, a 2160 x 1080 (FHD+) resolution ensures that individual pixels can   t be picked out, to the tune of 428ppi.Honor 9 Lite     PerformanceOne of the reasons Honor phones can often appear to offer more features than many of their budget rivals is because they have access to the cheaper processors of HiSilicon, which is owned by parent company Huawei.In the Honor 9 Lite   s case this means the 2.36GHz Kirin 659 CPU, which is the same chip that powers both the Honor 7X and the Huawei P Smart. It   s accompanied by 3GB of RAM, which is 1GB less than the 7X.The Kirin 659 is a lower-mid-range chip that appears to sit in the middle of Qualcomm   s entry-level offerings. An average Geekbench 4 multicore score of 3644 pitches the Honor 9 Lite well below the slightly more expensive Moto G5S Plus (with its Snapdragon 625) on 4460, but well above the similarly priced Moto G5S (packing a Snapdragon 430) on 2294Honor 9 Lite     SoftwareJust like the similarly specced Huawei P Smart, the Honor 9 Lite runs the latest version of Google   s mobile OS, Android 8.0 Oreo. This is a good thing.Honor 9 Lite     CameraRather impressively for a budget phone, Honor has managed to follow the Honor 9 and Honor 7X and equip the Honor 9 Lite with a dual camera setup. In fact, it   s gone one step further and provided a similar provision for selfies.Both the front and rear of the device play host to one 13-megapixel and one 2-megapixel sensor. Just as with the Honor 7X, the smaller secondary sensor is there purely to provide depth information for the included wide aperture and portrait modes.Honor 9 Lite     Battery lifeThe Honor 9 Lite comes with a 3000mAh battery, which is pretty typical for a phone of this size. It   s a little smaller than the 3340mAh battery of the similarly specced Honor 7X, but that phone has a larger and more demanding 6-inch display.Perhaps as a result, Honor claims that you can get an extra hour of offline video watching out of the Honor 9 Lite   s battery (13 hours rather than 12). In practice, we found that it ate through a similar amount of battery (14%) when watching a 50-minute downloaded TV programme with the screen brightness bumped right up, which isn   t great.Why buy the Honor 9 Lite?The Honor 9 Lite offers a number of strong features for a 13,000 price tag. Its all-screen design is something we still aren   t used to seeing at this price point, while general performance is reasonably snappyScore    Performance7    Camera7    Design7    Battery Life6    Value8    Software5    Calls & Sound7    Screen Quality8VerdictThe Honor 9 Lite   s bezel-light design and twin-lens camera tricks are eye catching, but it   s perhaps too quirky to fully take on the Motorola G-series at the top of the table.Honor 9 Lite (3 GB 32 GB) Blue", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["Waste of money...dont buy this phn...mi is much better than this", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["Very nice prodect ..", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["There's no headset in the box", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["Weight less and good battery back up and speedy....", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["Worst camera..

Honestly the only display which can give AMOLED display a run for it's money.Software: Runs on EMUI 8 based on Android 8 and is scheduled to get EMUI 9 based on Android 9 by June 2019. This is a super feature rich UI and will give u a tonne of feature that do not exist in Stock Android.its very well optimized too. Honestly I like EMUI over a lot of other UIs. It's mature and feature rich. Plus honor has been good with software updates. My pH is running the April Security Patch update.3. Processor : For today's standards the processor is definitely slow. Kirin 659 is almost a Snapdragon 630 equivalent. However u will feel that only if ur a gamer. Daily tasks r a breeze. So gamers stay away from this mobile. Others, PL go ahead and buy it. It's still a very good processor.4. Camera : it's got a superb pair of dual cameras which can click awesome pics is natural lighting and we'll lit artificial lighting conditions. The only place it struggles is low low lighting conditions. But then at this price u can't complaint. Same goes with the selfie cam too.5. Battery: Another con in the pH is it's battery. It's not pathetic, but definitely not for heavy users. It will easily last 1 working day for moderate users,but heavy users will have to top it up again in the evening and unfortunately no fast charging is supported.

Low light photos have some grains but much better than OP7.\n2. I was a bit skeptical about the flip camera but since it is made with the liquid metal it's more durable than you think.\n3. Infinite Display.\n4. Powered by snapdragon 855 offering awesome speed and smoothness.\n5. Navigation is superb just love the smoothness.\n6. Even though it runs on zen UI 6, you will not see any bloatware like Mi (I hate MiUI). Stock android like feeling with some additional features. \n7. GPU is Adreno 640, making games like PUBG and COD buttery-smooth (back might get warm after a while but it's common with every device, even with Samsung S10 and iPhone 11).\n7.  HDR 10 + (will speak about this in the latter part).\n8. The front is protected with Gorilla glass 6 and back with Gorilla Glass 3.\n9. Customizable function button (I am using it for torch).\n10. 600 Nits of luminosity (in simple terms awesome daylight readability). FYI, iPhone 11 has 610 Nits.\n11. Massive battery 5000 mAh. (Now it might look like your battery is draining fast but with moderate use, it will last for a day and a half.). To conserve more battery you have to stop playing around with the flip camera as it runs on a motor and motor consumes a lot of power.\n12. Plus point, a headphone jack with and high res earphone. (By the way, a good High res earphone comes around 2k).\n13. Awesome sound especially through earphones. Now I am Dolby Atmos guy and I had my doubts with DTS X, but it turned out to be amazing.\n14. Dedicated memory slot expandable up to 2 TB.\n15. Physical fingerprint sensor (I trust this more than in display).\n\nNow the cons.\n\n1. Its IPS LCD and not AMOLED (Now this has HDR 10+ which means the colors and display is as good as Amoled, plus no dead pixels like AMOLED. I think that's why Apple is sticking with LCD's).\n2. No in-display fingerprint (for some people it is a con).\n3. No  IP rating (but can handle some splashes).\n4. Even though Asus claims it has stereo speakers but the earpiece acting as a secondary speaker is not as good as OP7. It's more muffled and too low.\n5. Bit heavy and bulky 201g to be precise (but fits really well in hand).\n6. No depth sensor (Hey, what else you need in 28k).\n7. No pre-applied screen protection (But GG6).\n8. Since its flip camera, you can't take selfies while the phone is on a flat surface. But the camera is auto-retractable if it experiences some hurdle.\n\nNow you might ask Nikhil if the pros look like pros and the cons look like pros; what's the problem, why 3 star?\n\nNot everything with the device is roses and rainbows.\n\nThis device has a problem (not every device but mine has). I first noticed this on the second day, when I kept my phone to charge. The device rebooted itself and I wasn't even using it. At first, I thought it might be a glitch because not every device is perfect. Then the same thing happened again when I was scrolling through Instagram. The screen froze and restarted. \n\nYesterday  I was in my office and the phone was beside me, again the same thing happened, an auto reboot. Then I thought this thing is serious and I googled about the same and came to know that I am not the only one who is facing this issue. Even the negative reviews over here are filled with the same. When I spoke with ASUS representative he told me that this is a hardware issue and I have to go for a replacement.\n\nBefore that, I thought its just a glitch and can easily be resolved with an OTA update but things went south. Sadly you can't tell whether your device is faulty or not but you can run few tests to determine the same.\n\n1. Play high-end games like PUBG or COD for at least 60 minutes.\n2. Or download the Antutu app from playstore and do a stress test.\n\nIf any these test fails or your system restarts then it's faulty. As of now, my device is under the return process but it's a bit hard over here. They rejected the request 2 times. Has a window till 7 Nov. Hoping for the best.\n\nSorry, I didn't take any images to post.\n\nIf you still have doubts go with OP7 you will not regret it.\n\nHappy shopping.

This is my 3rd asus phone. I really like asus phones because of thier features they bringing each time on thier new phones. This time obviously the flip camera. Definitely redefining ordinary phones. After a long wait finally i got this phone in 26000rs during this big billion days. :)\nA quick comparison with new one plus 7 is - it don't have that liquid cooling feature which is somewhat helpful if you are a big game lover. I played pubg in this phone, it's heating little bit. But not like hot pan like heat. And not completely water resistant like oneplus. Other than this i didn't feel any other major draw backs when compared with oneplus. But have more common features like radio, microphone jack etc.\nCamera is really good. Low light photos could have been little more better. May be with upcomming update s this may solve. Battery life is really good. Fast charging is really helpfull to fill this 5000mah massive battery very quickly. \nThe main missing factor in this phone when i compare with my zenphone 3 is Asus's kids mode. That was really helpful for parent like me. And adaptive sensor need some adjustments which also required some improvement and it's little heavy because of that massive battery. If you are watching movies by holding in your hand, you may feel pain. But again it's not a big issue. My Zenfone 3 was so light.\nOther than these this is really a super nice solid phone guys.

I was drawn into the flip camera the most since it really offered some cool ways in which one could make use of the mobile camera.

It started restarting on its own randomly and sometimes it turns itself off and won't start.

Annoyed I made few calls to Flipkart ,where representatives helped me again to take up the case. Again Seller sent 2nd agent for inspection.

Now coming to the pros:-1) The Screen Quality is really nice. Also, according to me, it has the strongest build quality (of the screen) as I have dropped the phone many times directly on the screen and nothing happens *Note that I have not applied any Screen Guard or Protection, just it's cover (provided in the box) is enough to keep it safe* ...... So the inclusion on Gorilla Glass 6 will make it 5 to 6 times stronger..!!2) Ram Management of the 6gb ram varient is also the best in its price bracket (compared to RN5 pro and RN6 pro).3) Speaker Quality is             .4) Last but not the least, I have played PUBG continuously for 6hrs and 18mins and still, the battery percentage degraded from 100% to 18%.

But on every other aspect, this one lives upto my expectations. The thing I liked the most is the display and the Dolby audio feature. If you are a person who watches movies or listens to songs on phone be sure not to miss this one!

But if you are mostly into gaming, Redmi note 8 pro or any other phone with. better chipset would be ideal.\n\nIf I was helpful in assisting you with your buying decision, please do like/ mark helpful.\n\nThanks!", "65 users found this review helpful"], ["loved the moto stock android experience work smoot as butter", "36 users found this review helpful"], ["I've owned Moto E, Moto G, Moto X and Nexus devices from Motorola prior to this purchase & all purchased on Flipkart. I'm a pure Android fan. Never appreciated the bloatware that many manufacturers include with phones. Hence it was very easy for me to go ahead with this purchase. This phone is for those like me who understand you can't have everything by paying nothing; You need to compromise somewhere. I use phones mostly for Calls, Messages, WhatsApp, Online Shopping, Travel Bookings, YouTube, Netflix, Hotstar and other OTT Apps. Not a photography enthusiast, So camera is not a priority to me. \n\nAnd I'm into PC Gaming more than mobile so even this doesn't matter to me. If you're a serious mobile gamer, Consider phones with better CPU; Like Poco F1 which has a Snapdragon 800 Series at a great price point. If not, XiaoMi RedMi K20, Blackshark 2, OnePlus, ASUS ROG, Nubia RedMagic etc.,\n\nI'm rating 5 stars since there aren't many pure Android phones at this price point excluding XiaoMi A3. It was a tough call to pick this over A3, But the FHD+ display on the G8 Plus was the sole reason. If you don't prefer a Motorola then XiaoMi A3 is a good phone to consider. XiaoMi A3 as a part of Android One offers better timely updates as well.\n\nFeature Ratings:-\n\nOS Experience - 8/10\nBuild Quality - 7/10 \nDisplay - 8/10\nSound - 8/10\nCamera - 7/10\n\nDisappointed with Flipkart delivery experience.

Action camera is not tested enough to give a review. Though photos can't be clicked using Wide angle camera but while using it for taking video you can use the option of screenshot button to click photos. \n4) Performance is fast and smooth enough for doing all the day to day works.\n5) USB type-c port, it's pretty useful these days.\n6) Speaker is at the bottom and decent enough.\nNEUTRALS:-\n1)21:9 aspect ratio-it looks good when you play a supportive video but most of the time you'll find it useless bcoz maximum videos are not available in this aspect ratio including YT, Hotstar, Prime Video etc.\n2) Hardware- Backside is glossy plastic and it can't be used without the silicon cover provided with it or any other similar back over.\nCONS:-\n1)Battery backup is woefully low in comparison with any other similar device.. atleast 4000mAH battery is basic. If you are staying outdoor for long hours you have to keep powerbank with you. Also the charger provided with the phone is a slow charger not a turbo or fast charger, it take ages to charge the device specially if you are in a hurry.\n2) Display is the second most disappointing issue in this phone. You have to increase the brightness to atleast 40% -50% to be able to see anything in daylight. Also normal 15% 20% brightness is pretty dark and not suitable for watching movies or anything unlike other similar devices.\n3)Big round notch in the front screen for front camera looks very very ugly. it should have been much smaller. Due to this notch it's very hard to get a proper tampered glass for this phone.\n4) Gaming is not much tested in this phone but from whatever I played (NOT PUBG) though it handled well but device gets very hot in short period of time also you have to keep the graphics to low/medium for best results. So if you are planning to play Pubg look for other device not this one. Also the big camera notch is very problematic while gaming.\n5)Very difficult to reach contents which are in top of the screen as most of the time top notification bar will come down.\nFINAL WORD:\nIf you have budget of less than 15K and not an avid gamer this phone is made for you. Not only it has Google's Android One version also 128gb storage device under 15K is impossible to find. With few cons I'll still recommend this device just for the price.\nPlease give a like if you find this helpful!

I placed an order and It took me three days to receive. I'm writing this review after one and half day of use. I'm listing out the Pros and Cons of Motorola One Action that will helps you out for making choice:-\n\nPros:-\n1. 1080x2520 Screen Ratio, Full HD+ display and Dolby Sound takes you to the next level of watching movies or songs.\n\n2. Video shooting with ultra vide camera is like a in build Go-Pro camera in your phone.\n\n3. Android 9 Pie is very user-friendly and keeps you faster while ,Android One keeps you always updated before everyone else. Android also promised for Android ver 10&11 can be updated to this device.\n\n4. 4GB Ram & 128GB inbuild Storage capacity not needs to tell.\n\n5. 2.2GHz Octa Core Samsung Exynos 9609 processor is performing so well.\n\n6. I got this on Rs. 13,999/- on special offer.\n\nCons:-\n1. No turbo charging facility but still a good battery life. will not recommend to PUBG users.\n\n2. Front Camera Black Dot circle little bit highlighted for their size. but still manageble.\n\n3. Temper Glass not available in the market at the moment, you have to buy it online as of 14 Sep 19.\n\n4. Only launched in two colors but Denim Blue is still a killer one.\n\nConclusion:-\n\nI would strongly recommend to those users who like Motorola Brand because the facilities provided by Moto in this range is truly value for money. You can still find much more better specifications to other mobile phones bundle up in plastic cases but this one is brand Motorola. So I suggest end your search here and buy it immediately.\n\nThanks", "14 users found this review helpful"], ["Phone looks really stunning in the 21:9 Display. Viewing angles are good.
