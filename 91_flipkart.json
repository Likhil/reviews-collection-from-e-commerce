You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS. Now I want to share my 1 week experience with iPhone 11. 1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week. 2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion. 3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max. 4) Display is more or less good.

Here's what I think:\n\nThe build quality is kinda downgrade if you ask me. I am a fan of metal body build and do not care about wireless charging. So this glass build scares me a bit. It is also a tad heavier than OG Pixel  XL.\n\nDisplay is absolutely stunning. Notch doesn't bother me much and I may disable it if Google implements disabling of the notch in such a way that the status bar icon stays there.\n\nCameras (both front and rear) are just awesome. The wide angle front camera helps a lot if you want to fit in more people in your selfies. The camera app still doesn't have Night Sight just yet. Have not played around with it much.\n\nI just missed the stereo speaker from my Nexus 6P and the speaker on this one is quite loud. As reported by many P3XL users, if you play anything with higher volume you can literally feel it's vibration on the back of the device. The speakers are not balanced which is understandable due to the different sized speaker grills. I have no other reported issues with the speaker i.e. crackling noises, buzzing/clicking sounds etc.\n\nThe OS is fluid enough and since I have not used the phone extensively just yet, I am yet to see the widely reported RAM management issues. Right now it's smooth, fluid with zero lag. Surprisingly, the OS is on September patch which is kinda downgrade from my OG Pixel XL which was running the October patch. Don't know why they didn't push the September patch. My guess is they're concentrating more on fixing the bugs.\n\nBattery life seems to decent too. Charged it fully around 10 hours ago. 2 hours of Screen on time with 60% left.\n\nYet to check the audio from USB-C  to 3.5mm dongle but since it comes with the upgraded dongle it should be fine I guess. I do miss the 3.5mm jack though. Also planning to get the Apple USB-C  to 3.5mm dongle as a backup since it is reported to work fine with Pixel devices and is quite cheap for $9.\n\nAll in all pretty satisfied with the device.  I don't think I can use a non Pixel device now.", "8 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "02 Nov 2018,"], ["Writing this review after 15 days of use. nFirst thing is Google the brand itself is enough to buy this mobile without second thought. Now coming to the pros n cons of this mobile.nPros : nCamera - Just awesome. It works as per the expectation. Far better than any iPhone camera. Landscape mode is superb. And the one of the hidden feature of the this pixel is that it creates AI photo from your gallery by itself. Which is just awesome. ( Attached one sample pic here)nStock Android - Seamless experience. Does everything very smoothly and without any lag.nScreen -  Best in class.nBattery - Lasts almost 24 hrs based on your uses. nExtra feature - You have some extra and cool features like swapping between running apps. Google assistant wakes up by pressing the side of the phone. Works pretty well. Although you can increase or decrease it as per convenient.nLook - Just flawless. Looks awesome. The back side they have one third glossy finish which feels good in hand.nNotch - Looks ok but all the applications don't support this. It happens in all the mobile though.nSpeaker \ud83d\udd0a - You have got 2 speakers top n bottom. Which works very well. Sound is more than enough for mobile phone.nYou don't get 2 speakers in most of the smart phones. nFinger print scanner- Works like champ. nUnlimited Storage for your pics n videos.nnnCons-n Only C type port for both charging n headphones.
