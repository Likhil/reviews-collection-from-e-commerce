    "# Objective:\n",
    "To create a dataset where a product's specifications, cost, ratings are collocated along with the reviews from various E-commerce sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goal:\n",
    "This dataset helps in analyzing the reviews for a product collected from various E-commerce websites. Sentimental analysis or any other analysis can be done more accurately as the reviews are not biased for any website. \n",
    "\n",
    "The gist made from the analysis of all the reviews will make the buyer more informative about the product to make his/her decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset can also be used to compare various products of the same category as all the specifications of the product are being listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a buyer from E-commerce site wishes to go for a new product released in the market, where there is no scope for its working reviews, this dataset helps him/her to find the similar product if any was released  before from any other brand, and can be aware of the problems/advantages it gave to customers and helps buyer to make his/her decision.\n",

    "# Tools/softwares used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "Chromedriver \n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach/methodology\n",
    "We chose mobiles as the category for this project. We did scrape all the relevant information for mobiles needed from couple of websites named flipkart.com and 91mobiles.com\n",
    "1. Flipkart:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flipkart E-commerce site is of dynamic webpages which is highly developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To scrap the information for each mobile, we need to go to the respective url for that mobile, which manually takes time. So we automated this using selenium and wrote a python script(Flipkart_reviews.ipymb), which did the job for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plan for flipkart(File: Flipkart_reviews.ipynb):\n",
    "\n",
    "we send the input to search key as \"smartphone\" through the script, which listed all the phones with almost 217 pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "we collected name, link, ratings from these pages and stored in a dictionary with name as the key and rest in a list as value\n",
    "\n",
    "we looped over this dictionary where each element has link to its respective page. Likewise we automated the process to open each page and collect information like all the specifications for that specific mobile phone. For reviews, we made a list and appended each review to it. Reviews are spread over various pages, so we again looped to every page and collected all the reviews in that page and stored in a list which inturn stored as a value for key \"reviews\" in the product's specific dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "So all the products information is present in their corresponding dictionaries and we appended this as a write operation into a json file. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the loops are controlled by selenium and chromedriver\n",
    "\n",
    "This file finally contains all the information for each mobile phone in json format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 91mobiles.com:\n",
    "\n",
    "91mobiles.com is also an E-commerce website , where we can find the reviews for the product from amazon. This is a dynamic website, which is highly developed. This is a JavaScript webpage\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plan for 91mobiles.com(File: Amazon_reviews.ipynb):\n",
    "Here, the mobile phones are categorized according to their brands. So we used that as an advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We scraped and collected the links for the brands along with brand names.\n",
    "\n",
    "we looped over each brand link to get all the phones in that brand, here we collected individual mobile's information such as link for the mobile, along with mobile name. This is stored in a dictionary with mobile's name as the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "we looped over this dictionary to open the mobile's respective page, and scraped information like rating and how many users did gave the rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reviews, how many did find this review useful, as we are interested in amazon customer reviews, we found the filter element and sent keys \"Amazon.in\".\n",
    "\n",
    "All the reviews, useful count is collected into a dictionary and wrote these dictionaries as json into a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviews are not in page wise format, rather in a dynamic scroll type. so we used selenium to scroll the current web page to scrap the reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the loops are controlled by selenium and chromedriver.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data integration(File: data integration.ipynb):\n",
    "\n",
    "The data inserted was not in proper format, so we converted it to string and added few keys to make into a proper json's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we converted all the string back to json.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changed the keys of json's dictionary from numbers to the product's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "junk characters from price column and name column are removed and replaced respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated all the above steps for amazon dataset as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "the two new datasets are merged basing on their names\n",
    "\n",
    "stored the merged dictionary into a json file\n",
    "\n",
    "converted json structure to csv using pandas dataframes where nulls are inserted for attributes absent for respective phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final csv and json merged datasets are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenges faced:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flipkart is a commercial e-commerce website, where the filter to primarily fetch phones according to their brands was in their home page. We developed our code to scrap according to the structure, But as it is a commercial website, there was a sale happening on December 1st and entire structure has been re-formatted from their end for sale. This made us to use another approach for fetching the mobiles, that was by search key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In 91mobiles, the reviews we can get by scrolling the page, which was quite a new task and we achieved it with selenium.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. While scraping, there was a high chance where site used to block us. If we focus on creating a single dictionary and store each element as a product, when it fails, all the stored information was locked and went of no use. So we followed a method to append each element to the file once it is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This append further created a problem, as the file which gets individual dictionaries is not in a json format as the append just adds to the end of the file.\n",
    "--> we did convert the whole file to a string and individually looped over a pattern and added numbers as the key to it. So it was into json format.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.There are some junk characters in price like Indian rupee symbol which are hidden and not being able to remove. Need to research more on how to remove them\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Limitation: We can scrap from various sites but as these E-commerce sites are commercial, we are not allowed/authorized to scrap.\n",

    "# Future Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to analyze all the reviews for a particular smartphone by using various methods like text analytics and sentimental analysis with the help of natural language processing a final verdict or overall review should be given for the specific phone which covers the gist of almost all the customer reviews. This will help the customer to make his decision quicker than going through several reviews and being ended up in mess.\n",
