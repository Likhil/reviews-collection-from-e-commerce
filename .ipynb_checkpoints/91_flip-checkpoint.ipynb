       "   [\"May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.           \",\n",

Loads people still cry about touch id not there but they are so wrong.Face ID is so fast and so cool I am just loving it.5- Camera Kills all the flagship android phone. What amazing photos you can click with this phone night mode is the rockstar.So Bottomline whoever is thinking to buy this phone just go for it you won't regret           \",\n",

       "   ['            Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys. Haters will always hate!  ',\n",

I am disappointed as it was shown the airpods with the phone but instead of that they send the wired earphones. If someone is buying the phone in 60k plus he or she should be given the things which is mentioned at least.  I am waiting if the airpods are being sent by the seller else will return the phone due to wrong description . How ever other things are fine and looks are great. Will give a brief review later.

       "   [\"May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.           \",\n",

       "   [\"            I am moving from iphone 8 to iphone 11 and its a worthy upgrade. Even though my iphone 8 is still good and fast, I love using my iphone 11. Its a 85% iphone 11 pro at 65% of the price. So, in apple terms it is value for money.The good:- Fast processor! Same as iphone 11 pro/pro max- Awesome camera's (Again same as iphone 11pro and pro max except for the telephoto lens which can zoom 2x). Captures amazing low light pics. Ultra wide pics are good too! Best video camera ever in a phone.- Great battery backup. Lasts me a day. 1 hr gaming. A lot of browsing and chatting and some location tracking and still 15% at EOD.- iOS 13 is now mature and awesome to use. moved seamlessly from my iphone 8.The not so good:- Screen. Well its not an OLED! But still decent enough. Decent to look at. You wont feel its bad but its not great!- Front camera is average. Doesnt have a night mode. And the images are decent but not great again. Front wide angle is a joke.- 5W charger in box! Apple, I cannot hate you enough for this. You sell a 70k rs phone and give us a slow charger.What iphone 11 pro/pro max have but this doesnt?- OLED Screen (if you a fan of amazing to look at screens. I dont miss it)- Telephoto lens (Again I dont miss it ever! I mean how often would you require a 2x zoom? Its not like a 5x optical)- Metallic side body (In a cover you dont need a metallic body and I drop my phones so often that they are always protected in a cover)- Fast charger in box. I bought it online separately(HATE YOU APPLE FOR THIS)- Thats it!!!I cant see why most people would go for pro models! There is hardly any value addition and unless you have a lot of spare money, iphone 11 can everything what and iphone 11 pro/pro max can do!  \",\n",

If someone is buying the phone in 60k plus he or she should be given the things which is mentioned at least.

       "   ['            The phone is super quick, is intuitive to use, has good cameras and the battery easily lasts a day.The only grouse I have is the screen. While many may not have felt it, I surely felt shortchanged. I switched from a Samsung S10e to iphone 11. The s10e had a beautiful Oled screen, some notches above this one. Just couldn   t digest a mediocre screen on a phone that costs more than 60k.I was also able to compare the camera with that of the S10e, and the results were mixed. It took better selfie and portrait pics, but fell little short in rear camera pics. No doubt, it has a very good camera system but definitely doesn   t live up to the hype of    the best camera ever on a smartphone   .  ',\n",

       "   [\"            I really like the performance while playing games, while shooting 4k videos, and the battery life. While the camera may be the best on a smartphone, sometimes i do prefer to use my professional camera, but for every other task, it is good.The video stabilisation is also the best on a smartphone but not quite on the same level as panasonic cameras.The screen, well i cant really tell any difference between this and a 1080 or 1440p screen, it's really good. The bezels on the side do stand out though (not bothered by the notch, that's functional),If you zoom out to the ultrawide while shooting videos, you do lose the good stabilisation.Overall it's a great product, it has the best processor, sufficient RAM that you won't notice, and it being an apple product will keep getting updates for a long time, making it a long lasting phone, the camera is the best in a smartphone and you will be happy using it. When you buy an apple product you pay for the software developments and updates that come with it  \",\n",

       "   [\"            I am moving from iphone 8 to iphone 11 and its a worthy upgrade. Even though my iphone 8 is still good and fast, I love using my iphone 11. Its a 85% iphone 11 pro at 65% of the price. So, in apple terms it is value for money.The good:- Fast processor! Same as iphone 11 pro/pro max- Awesome camera's (Again same as iphone 11pro and pro max except for the telephoto lens which can zoom 2x). Captures amazing low light pics. Ultra wide pics are good too! Best video camera ever in a phone.- Great battery backup. Lasts me a day. 1 hr gaming. A lot of browsing and chatting and some location tracking and still 15% at EOD.- iOS 13 is now mature and awesome to use. moved seamlessly from my iphone 8.The not so good:- Screen. Well its not an OLED! But still decent enough. Decent to look at. You wont feel its bad but its not great!- Front camera is average. Doesnt have a night mode. And the images are decent but not great again. Front wide angle is a joke.- 5W charger in box! Apple, I cannot hate you enough for this. You sell a 70k rs phone and give us a slow charger.What iphone 11 pro/pro max have but this doesnt?- OLED Screen (if you a fan of amazing to look at screens. I dont miss it)- Telephoto lens (Again I dont miss it ever! I mean how often would you require a 2x zoom? Its not like a 5x optical)- Metallic side body (In a cover you dont need a metallic body and I drop my phones so often that they are always protected in a cover)- Fast charger in box. I bought it online separately(HATE YOU APPLE FOR THIS)- Thats it!!!I cant see why most people would go for pro models! There is hardly any value addition and unless you have a lot of spare money, iphone 11 can everything what and iphone 11 pro/pro max can do!  \",\n",

This is a premium segment phone and it performs as expected. Things are a bit smoother compared to android,  the features are quite mature and handy.I won't say ios is great or exceptional but it seems quite mature compared to android, I am sure Android will improve day by dayOne problem I noticed that the system apps are using GPS excessively.

       "   [\"            This is my first iPhone. After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.-----------------------************------------------------Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.------------------------***********-----------------------Cons:1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.--------------------************----------------------Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.***************************************Love the black color.***************************************Fun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care.  \",\n",

       "   ['I   ve been using iPhone 6s for the past 4 years and last week it stopped working. Ordered iPhone 11 on Sunday evening. Got it on Monday morning amaziiing delivery service by Amazon.Been using this for a week. Amazing battery life, I   m actually feeling the difference. For the detailed review read below :PROS1.) BATTERY LIFE IS GREAAAT. Coming from 6s it   s a huge upgrade. My phone lasts me a day and a half in case of normal use. A day in case I stream a lot of Netflix.2.) CAMERA. I haven   t been able to test it outside. I   ve just clicked a few pictures of people indoors and it feels like a huge upgrade from my 6s. As soon as I test it out, will edit this portion.3.) FACE ID. It   s fast. Quicker than fingerprint and effortless.4.) PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING. I bought this in purple and it   s really beautiful.CONS (Might vary from person to person. I wasn   t really bothered by this)1.) CHARGING TIME TOO MUCH. It takes a while to charge with the stock charger. You need a fast charger for actual fast charging. It would be good if you invest in one.2.) DISPLAY. It isn   t an OLED display which sucks after paying a lot of money. But then you don   t really notice this one unless you compare it with an IPhone 11 Pro side by side3.) BEZELS. It has thicker bezels than the iPhone X, XS and 11 pro models. It would bother anyone who   s coming from a phone with thinner bezels. My suggestion is don   t upgrade to this in case you have a X. Wait till next year.4.) NOTCH. Again, this depends on your preference. It   s not that bothering though.iPhone 11 is a great phone for that price tag. I   ve been using iPhones since 3GS. You get the Pro model features without shedding extra money. If you can go for this, you should.           ',\n",

Lo light photography is speechless. Battery performance is much better and phone does not get drained out quickly. Fast charging is commendable though it doesn't come bundled with fast charger.Ninth, I am missing notification LED light.Weight of the phone is heavy.

My day ends at 2300hrs and I   m always left out with approx 32-46% battery. The standby time is just great no battery drains when not in use and I mean it ! No battery drains. That A13 Bionic is just a beast and let   s just not talk about the performance. A true destructive amazing fast performance is always guaranteed.

       "   ['            The camera setup is itself a attraction and the fast and reliable faceID just steals my heart.The phone is super fast. It serves well for a whole day in one full battery charge.The iPhone 11 is an awesome piece of machine used for the day to day mobile usage. It is a beast for the android and the first love for the iPhone users.The battery is improved a lot and the camera setup is awesome.The option of different colors make it very choice of one to choose from.However I am comparing it below:-Differences from iPhone 11 pro1. Only two cameras but they serve the purpose well in 11.2. The battery is better in iPhone 11.3. The screen quality is a bit on lower side in iPhone 11.4. Processors and the charging procedure is same.5. You don   t get a fast charger with iPhone 11.Compared to iPhone XS.1. The processor is way better in 11.2. The screen quality is on lower side than XS.3. The battery life is very much improved in 11.4. Of course it is a must upgrade from XS.  ',\n",

[No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi].After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore  for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up. Show some sense of urgency towards customer issues.Ok...folks its upto you to buy or not, just sharing my own experience so it will help who are thinking to buy this.  ',\n",

The phone has two 12MP cameras, one wide and the other ultra-wide. The wide-angle camera itself is not a new concept, but Apple   s take of a wide-angle camera is. In fact, the 120-degree field of view is packed into a 4:3 frame, which is unique and giving a whole new perspective. While if does not give the images a fish eye look, especially in landscapes, it ends up being a different way to showcase a landscape photo.The iPhone 11 is also a good handycam replacement because you can shoot 4K at 60FPS using both the lenses and this ability to switch to ultra-wide for video is seamless. I loved the fact that even with slow-motion, both the lenses come into play. The video experience on this phone is the smoothest I have seen so far and it also stays cool even after long 4K shoots.Apple iPhone 11 specifications: 6.1-inch LCD Liquid Retina HD display, 1792 x 828   pixel resolution at 326 ppi | A13 Bionic chipset | Dual 12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras with 2x optical zoom out; digital zoom up to 5x, Ultra Wide:   /2.4 aperture and 120   field of view, Wide:   /1.8 aperture | TrueDepth Camera (Front camera) 12MP camera with   /2.2 aperture | Battery: One hour longer than iPhone XR | IP68 rating for dust and water resistance |  ',\n",

But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost.

       "   [\"After using iPhone 11 for about a month, I am writing this review. So please read.When you are on shopping for a premium phone, you should look for a few important things, especially spending so much money on a device.1. The brand value. Ultimately you should be proud to take your phone out in between a crowd2. Super features. especially the camera3. Beautiful looks.All of the above are satisfied with this phone. And there is no reason one should not buy this phone. Not convinced? Read on my full review.=== Camera ===I used Samsung S series since S2 and switched to Note series since Note 5 till Note 9. So this time I switched the brand and I don't regret. Compare to my Note 9 cameras, iPhone 11 cameras are far superior in terms of taking selfies or regular photos. Just point your subject and instantly focuses on the subject and the background will be blurred like the pro-grade camera. My friends don't believe that the photos taken are on a phone and not DSLR. That itself says all.=== Screen ===Not a super sensitive screen like the super awesome AMOLED one on my Note 9, but it doesn't fall behind as well. The screen is super responsive and shows the colors accurately. However, it feels smaller compared to my Note 9 screen or even iPhone 11 Pro. I don't say this screen is the ultimate screen but is very good at this price point. If you want an ultimate screen, go for the iPhone 11 Pro which has OLED screen.=== Software ===This is the pain point. After using Android for so many years, you will feel very inconvenient with iOS. But once you started using it, you will find it easy. Just a word of caution: If you are using Whatsapp, you will lose all your existing chats and data. There is no way to migrate your data from Android to iPhone. The only possible way is buying third party software which costs $20 dollars and that too does not work 100% correct. So be prepared to lose your WhatsApp data before migration.=== App Ecosystem ===Nothing to complain here. Everything available on Android is also there on iOS and to be frank more than Android. So this is one of the plus points. But the minus point is - all iOS developers want to milk money out of users. Some apps/games which are free on Android are paid on iOS.=== Services ===If you are an avid user of Google services, you find something missing or uncomfortable in using their services. Android so much integrated with Google services such as GMail, Drive, Maps, Photos and so on; you will find all of them on iOS but are no so much integrated.  My suggestion is to switch to Apple services wherever possible.=== Battery ===The battery lasts the whole day and is one of the best. However, the charger that comes with the phone is a low end charger. It won't have a quick charging facility. So I started using my Note 9 charger which works better.So that's all about my journey so far with the amazing iPhone 11.           \",\n",

Also night mode is premium feature of this phone no flash still light , its a magic.4) Sound- Sterea sound with surround effect seems to be in theater Overall its a good deal to go for .  ',\n",

Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted.

Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone.

You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use \"in the box\" accessories like \"EarPods with Lighting Connector\", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I\\'ve never tried the iPhone before and I\\'m using this for the first time (Yes, I\\'m already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I\\'m just lovin it.

It has none. Seriously none.If you are interested in photography then only go for it, else NO.I was a little sceptical too, but then I bought it, and it's just okayThere's no awesome thing about it. Even camera in night mode gets real average.I have been facing issue with screen display. I tried to fix it using some feedbacks but It just didn't work out.I haven't tried hardcore gaming.Most importantly:- Phone will go unnoticed everywhere cause of it's typical design unlike an iPhone.Invest in iphone if you are really ready for 70k.           \",\n",

       "   [\"I have been using this phone for about 40 - 50 days, The battery life was decent. All of a sudden for some reason, the charging cable does not get properly fit into the charging port. Considering it is a USB Type C cable, existing power banks and car charging adapter wouldn't work, which was problematic. Google customer care support executives were helpful i.e they said someone would come and pick up the phone, provide a temporary phone, they would have the phone repaired and would return the phone in 7 - 10 business days. The technician is supposed to help out tomorrow, will update the review once everything is said and done!Update: It turned out to be some lint in the charging port. The technician didn   t had to visit. Other than the above mentioned little issues it   s a good phone regarding performance, network etc...           \",\n",

It's customer care support is misguiding its customers by suggesting them to take the help of mobile carrier services. JIO SIM offers this feature whereby we do not keep our mobile data on to execute video call with other JIO users. As per a absurd reply from pixel 3xl customer care service video call is not possible in pixel phone without Google duo. So poor customer care support. Single SIM. Software updation could enable the VoLTE feature.           \",\n",
