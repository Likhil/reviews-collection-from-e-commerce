It goes from 1% to 100% in 1 hour 15 minutes with the phone and 4g on..Oppo f11 has the same specifications as f11 pro..Only difference is the motorized camera and 0.2 % more screen size..And I was unwilling to sacrifice 6000 more for this little enhancementThis phone competes with redmi note 7 pro, realme 3 pro and samsung m30And its looks and battery beats all 3 of them..Including m30's 5000 mah battery.It has premium gradient looks, superb camera with AI setups, 128 gb memory and a display that beats all other displays mentioned aboveThe 4gb ram is sufficient and realme or note 7's 6gb ram is a hoax as far as its performance is consideredThe only drawback is some pre installed apps in color os 6 and no separate sd card slot..u can either use 2 Sims or 1 sim and one sd card (upto 512 gb) in it..Overall it's the best overall phone in the below 20k segment..N it's better than oppo f11 pro..The only cutback is the price..Otherwise u can't chose anything between it and oppo f11 pro...

I went to service centre they analysed for 2 hrs and said phone strip and cable have some issue and i asked them to replace it. They want me to handover my mobile and wait for 5 to 6 working days. Now i have warrent i will claim. After 6 month the same problem persist we need to pay money for the issue to solve.  I analised the following cases today while waiting in service centre.. for 9/10 issues many of them are realme users. Follwing issues came* Realme xt finger print and password not working just swipe up it will open.( This both realme xt are only a 2 days mobile)* Another realme xt user came that his mobil brightness  reaches zero at ni8 and had a bad experience.*Realme c2 user had automatic turn off and on issue* Another realme user came i walked out after taken my mobile back.So think twice before buying realme. Or go to netest realme service centre and just analyse how many realme users vist the shop daily.

This means it does feel somewhat dated, especially when placed down next to  Samsung\'s Galaxy S8, although those fond of Apple\'s go-to design unlikely will have any complaints.         This dated feel is largely down to the  chunky bezels that surround  the 4.7in screen, with Apple\'s rivals - and even Apple itself - making the move towards full-screen, bezel-free devices. This does mean that there\'s room for Apple\'s trusty Touch ID sensor underneath the display, though, which has so far worked flawlessly every time.       Like the  iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 is waterproof too, thanks to the handset\'s IP67 certification which means, in theory, it should withstand being dunked into water up to 1 metre for 30 minutes. This has rung true for us so far, but we  try and avoid getting the handset too wet given its exposed ports on the bottom.         The iPhone 8 is a tad heavier than last year\'s iPhone 7 at 148g, which we found made it feel more robust. It apparently is, according to Apple, which boasts that the glass on the phone\'s rear is the ""most durable glass ever on an iPhone."" We haven\'t managed to drop our iPhone 8 yet, but it feels like it could withstand a tumble or two.       Elsewhere on the handset you\'ll find the Lightning port on the bottom edge is flanked by a speaker and microphone, and there\'s nothing up top. There\'s no return for the 3.5mm audio jack, but Apple includes a Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter in the box.       There\'s also updated stereo speakers, which make the phone around 25 percent louder than the iPhone 7.       DISPLAY:    The iPhone 8\'s display is largely identical to the iPhone 7. And the 6S, and, er, the iPhone 6. This means that the 4.7in screen, with its 1,334x750 resolution, does feel somewhat  old-fashioned, not to mention small, compared to the likes of the Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2, again, added to by the bezels that surround it. Quality wise, while it pales against its rivals on paper, we\'ve no complaints, and it continues to be among the sharpest and most vibrant on the market.       The only real change to the iPhone 8\'s screen is the addition of Apple\'s True-Tone technology that first debuted on the 9.7in iPad Pro.  This True Tone alters the colour temperature of the display depending on the environment in which you\'re in, reducing the harsh blue tones typical of an LCD when you\'re in a  dimly lit room.       PERFORMANCE:    Apple\'s new A11 Bionic chip sits under the hood of the iPhone 8 and, as expected, it\'s incredibly fast.       Specs-wise, the six-core CPU comprises of two low-performance cores and four high-performance cores, with the regular cores being 25 per cent faster than the previous A10 chip, and the high-performance cores being up to 75 per cent faster than the A10 SoC, according to Apple It also comes paired with Apple\'s first homegrown GPU, which offers 30 per cent more performance than the A10.       SOFTWARE:    The iPhone 8 ships with iOS 11, naturally, which brings  with it improvements to Siri, reworked lock screen notifications, a new-look Control Centre and Apple\'s redesigned App Store.       CAMERA:    On paper,  the main camera on the iPhone 8 is no different to that found on the iPhone 7, with Apple retaining the same 12MP sensor with built-in f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilisation (OIS).       The biggest changes come on the video side of things with 4K recording now available at 60fps and slo-mo video now 1080p at 240fps - both of which are double the iPhone 7 and the former is a first for any smartphone.       I tried it out in a variety of different lighting conditions, indoor and out, and  were impressed with the camera\'s capabilities - in particular when low lighting is involved, something our iPhone 8 struggled to cope with. This is aided by the always-on HDR, which increases saturation while retaining more natural and realistic colours than images shot on the Note 8, for example.         The biggest changes are seen on the video side,  with 4K recording now available at 60fps and slo-mo video now 1080p at 240fps - double what the iPhone 7 has on offer.       On the front of the phone you\'ll find a 7MP camera f/2.2 aperture, Retina Flash and 1080p video recording,  and while this isn\'t as great in low-light as the rear-facing snapper, it\'s perfectly good enough for the occasional selfie and Snapchatting, or whatever it is you kids get up to. Unfortunately, however, you don\'t get Apple\'s new Portrait Mode on the iPhone 8, nor the new Portrait Lighting feature that the iPhone 8 Plus has.       BATTERY LIFE:    According to Apple, the battery inside the iPhone 8 will  last around two hours longer than the iPhone 7\'s, despite weighing in slightly smaller at  1,821mAh.This has proved accurate during my time with the iPhone 8 so far. It usually gets me to the end of the day - just, whereas I usually had to charge my iPhone 8 most evenings.       It\'s much less of a hassle to charge the iPhone 8 too, as it - along with the iPhone X - is Apple\'s first smartphone to support wireless charging. What\'s more, whereas Apple usually requires expensive propriety accessories, the iPhone 8 supports the Qi wireless charging standard, which means it\'ll work with most third-party charges on the market.         VERDICT:    In short the iPhone 8 is an excellent phone and there are some great new editions to get excited about, such as the inclusion of wireless charging for the first time and Apple\'s new A11 Bionic CPU, which is benchmarks are anything to go by, is the fastest mobile CPU on the market right now.         Beyond that, though, the iPhone 8 is an incremental update over last year\'s iPhone 7, and its large bezels and three-year-old design mean it does feel somewhat dated compared to the likes of the Galaxy S8 and Pixel XL 2, despite carrying a similarly-expensive price-tag.

This means it does feel somewhat dated, especially when placed down next to  Samsung\'s Galaxy S8, although those fond of Apple\'s go-to design unlikely will have any complaints.         This dated feel is largely down to the  chunky bezels that surround  the 4.7in screen, with Apple\'s rivals - and even Apple itself - making the move towards full-screen, bezel-free devices. This does mean that there\'s room for Apple\'s trusty Touch ID sensor underneath the display, though, which has so far worked flawlessly every time.       Like the  iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 is waterproof too, thanks to the handset\'s IP67 certification which means, in theory, it should withstand being dunked into water up to 1 metre for 30 minutes. This has rung true for us so far, but we  try and avoid getting the handset too wet given its exposed ports on the bottom.         The iPhone 8 is a tad heavier than last year\'s iPhone 7 at 148g, which we found made it feel more robust. It apparently is, according to Apple, which boasts that the glass on the phone\'s rear is the ""most durable glass ever on an iPhone."" We haven\'t managed to drop our iPhone 8 yet, but it feels like it could withstand a tumble or two.       Elsewhere on the handset you\'ll find the Lightning port on the bottom edge is flanked by a speaker and microphone, and there\'s nothing up top. There\'s no return for the 3.5mm audio jack, but Apple includes a Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter in the box.       There\'s also updated stereo speakers, which make the phone around 25 percent louder than the iPhone 7.       DISPLAY:    The iPhone 8\'s display is largely identical to the iPhone 7. And the 6S, and, er, the iPhone 6. This means that the 4.7in screen, with its 1,334x750 resolution, does feel somewhat  old-fashioned, not to mention small, compared to the likes of the Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2, again, added to by the bezels that surround it. Quality wise, while it pales against its rivals on paper, we\'ve no complaints, and it continues to be among the sharpest and most vibrant on the market.       The only real change to the iPhone 8\'s screen is the addition of Apple\'s True-Tone technology that first debuted on the 9.7in iPad Pro.  This True Tone alters the colour temperature of the display depending on the environment in which you\'re in, reducing the harsh blue tones typical of an LCD when you\'re in a  dimly lit room.       PERFORMANCE:    Apple\'s new A11 Bionic chip sits under the hood of the iPhone 8 and, as expected, it\'s incredibly fast.       Specs-wise, the six-core CPU comprises of two low-performance cores and four high-performance cores, with the regular cores being 25 per cent faster than the previous A10 chip, and the high-performance cores being up to 75 per cent faster than the A10 SoC, according to Apple It also comes paired with Apple\'s first homegrown GPU, which offers 30 per cent more performance than the A10.       SOFTWARE:    The iPhone 8 ships with iOS 11, naturally, which brings  with it improvements to Siri, reworked lock screen notifications, a new-look Control Centre and Apple\'s redesigned App Store.       CAMERA:    On paper,  the main camera on the iPhone 8 is no different to that found on the iPhone 7, with Apple retaining the same 12MP sensor with built-in f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilisation (OIS).       The biggest changes come on the video side of things with 4K recording now available at 60fps and slo-mo video now 1080p at 240fps - both of which are double the iPhone 7 and the former is a first for any smartphone.       I tried it out in a variety of different lighting conditions, indoor and out, and  were impressed with the camera\'s capabilities - in particular when low lighting is involved, something our iPhone 8 struggled to cope with. This is aided by the always-on HDR, which increases saturation while retaining more natural and realistic colours than images shot on the Note 8, for example.         The biggest changes are seen on the video side,  with 4K recording now available at 60fps and slo-mo video now 1080p at 240fps - double what the iPhone 7 has on offer.       On the front of the phone you\'ll find a 7MP camera f/2.2 aperture, Retina Flash and 1080p video recording,  and while this isn\'t as great in low-light as the rear-facing snapper, it\'s perfectly good enough for the occasional selfie and Snapchatting, or whatever it is you kids get up to. Unfortunately, however, you don\'t get Apple\'s new Portrait Mode on the iPhone 8, nor the new Portrait Lighting feature that the iPhone 8 Plus has.       BATTERY LIFE:    According to Apple, the battery inside the iPhone 8 will  last around two hours longer than the iPhone 7\'s, despite weighing in slightly smaller at  1,821mAh.This has proved accurate during my time with the iPhone 8 so far. It usually gets me to the end of the day - just, whereas I usually had to charge my iPhone 8 most evenings.       It\'s much less of a hassle to charge the iPhone 8 too, as it - along with the iPhone X - is Apple\'s first smartphone to support wireless charging. What\'s more, whereas Apple usually requires expensive propriety accessories, the iPhone 8 supports the Qi wireless charging standard, which means it\'ll work with most third-party charges on the market.         VERDICT:    In short the iPhone 8 is an excellent phone and there are some great new editions to get excited about, such as the inclusion of wireless charging for the first time and Apple\'s new A11 Bionic CPU, which is benchmarks are anything to go by, is the fastest mobile CPU on the market right now.         Beyond that, though, the iPhone 8 is an incremental update over last year\'s iPhone 7, and its large bezels and three-year-old design mean it does feel somewhat dated compared to the likes of the Galaxy S8 and Pixel XL 2, despite carrying a similarly-expensive price-tag.

The Realme C2 starts at Rs. 5,999 .It's good in battery life , software,design and bad because it's performance is weak.Realme C2 has set new records as they have launched the best phone for just 6K.when Xiaomi was the only brand for beginners range but now Realme has come in the market to compete with them.Realme C2 is a complete and a great device for normal gamers but great entertainers and Realme C2 is a heavily configured phone with money-value.But there are some drawbacks so we talk about that1.The phone has a delicate plastic body which makes it a bit fragile and more prone to accidental damages. So you have to very cautious while handling it.2.The phone lacks a Fingerprint sensor .3.you cannot enjoy had videos in this smartphone.4.Cameras are average and do not perform as per expectations in low light and indoor lighting condition.Overall, the photos are respectable for a budget phone camera but don   t expect much.If you   re a clean and minimal stock android lover, then the plenty of features and apps might overwhelm you.the phone has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a lone speaker grill at the bottom, power button to the right and volume rockers to the left alongside the SIM tray. The buttons are tactile, the headphone and speaker output are more than okay at this budget.The phone   s decent display with fair color accuracy leaves us wishing it were a bit brighter tooThe Realme C2 is definitely a device you should go for as it delivers great performance and features. The most satisfying thing is its price that will wow your mind.We are gonna see how the Realme C2 holds up against the competition and why should you select it over other phones.

Honor calls its approach FullView, which basically refers to devices with a higher screen-to-device ratio.Honor 9 Lite     ScreenMaking the front of your phone even more about the display than usual places extra pressure on the quality of the screen itself. Thankfully, the Honor 9 Lite isn   t found wanting in this respect.This is a nicely sized 5.65-inch IPS LCD screen, with decent viewing angles, contrast and strong brightness when you need to crank things up. You   d need to spend considerably more money to find something much better. Meanwhile, a 2160 x 1080 (FHD+) resolution ensures that individual pixels can   t be picked out, to the tune of 428ppi.Honor 9 Lite     PerformanceOne of the reasons Honor phones can often appear to offer more features than many of their budget rivals is because they have access to the cheaper processors of HiSilicon, which is owned by parent company Huawei.In the Honor 9 Lite   s case this means the 2.36GHz Kirin 659 CPU, which is the same chip that powers both the Honor 7X and the Huawei P Smart. It   s accompanied by 3GB of RAM, which is 1GB less than the 7X.The Kirin 659 is a lower-mid-range chip that appears to sit in the middle of Qualcomm   s entry-level offerings. An average Geekbench 4 multicore score of 3644 pitches the Honor 9 Lite well below the slightly more expensive Moto G5S Plus (with its Snapdragon 625) on 4460, but well above the similarly priced Moto G5S (packing a Snapdragon 430) on 2294Honor 9 Lite     SoftwareJust like the similarly specced Huawei P Smart, the Honor 9 Lite runs the latest version of Google   s mobile OS, Android 8.0 Oreo. This is a good thing.Honor 9 Lite     CameraRather impressively for a budget phone, Honor has managed to follow the Honor 9 and Honor 7X and equip the Honor 9 Lite with a dual camera setup. In fact, it   s gone one step further and provided a similar provision for selfies.Both the front and rear of the device play host to one 13-megapixel and one 2-megapixel sensor. Just as with the Honor 7X, the smaller secondary sensor is there purely to provide depth information for the included wide aperture and portrait modes.Honor 9 Lite     Battery lifeThe Honor 9 Lite comes with a 3000mAh battery, which is pretty typical for a phone of this size. It   s a little smaller than the 3340mAh battery of the similarly specced Honor 7X, but that phone has a larger and more demanding 6-inch display.Perhaps as a result, Honor claims that you can get an extra hour of offline video watching out of the Honor 9 Lite   s battery (13 hours rather than 12). In practice, we found that it ate through a similar amount of battery (14%) when watching a 50-minute downloaded TV programme with the screen brightness bumped right up, which isn   t great.Why buy the Honor 9 Lite?The Honor 9 Lite offers a number of strong features for a 13,000 price tag.

Honor calls its approach FullView, which basically refers to devices with a higher screen-to-device ratio.Honor 9 Lite     ScreenMaking the front of your phone even more about the display than usual places extra pressure on the quality of the screen itself. Thankfully, the Honor 9 Lite isn   t found wanting in this respect.This is a nicely sized 5.65-inch IPS LCD screen, with decent viewing angles, contrast and strong brightness when you need to crank things up. You   d need to spend considerably more money to find something much better. Meanwhile, a 2160 x 1080 (FHD+) resolution ensures that individual pixels can   t be picked out, to the tune of 428ppi.Honor 9 Lite     PerformanceOne of the reasons Honor phones can often appear to offer more features than many of their budget rivals is because they have access to the cheaper processors of HiSilicon, which is owned by parent company Huawei.In the Honor 9 Lite   s case this means the 2.36GHz Kirin 659 CPU, which is the same chip that powers both the Honor 7X and the Huawei P Smart. It   s accompanied by 3GB of RAM, which is 1GB less than the 7X.The Kirin 659 is a lower-mid-range chip that appears to sit in the middle of Qualcomm   s entry-level offerings. An average Geekbench 4 multicore score of 3644 pitches the Honor 9 Lite well below the slightly more expensive Moto G5S Plus (with its Snapdragon 625) on 4460, but well above the similarly priced Moto G5S (packing a Snapdragon 430) on 2294Honor 9 Lite     SoftwareJust like the similarly specced Huawei P Smart, the Honor 9 Lite runs the latest version of Google   s mobile OS, Android 8.0 Oreo. This is a good thing.Honor 9 Lite     CameraRather impressively for a budget phone, Honor has managed to follow the Honor 9 and Honor 7X and equip the Honor 9 Lite with a dual camera setup. In fact, it   s gone one step further and provided a similar provision for selfies.Both the front and rear of the device play host to one 13-megapixel and one 2-megapixel sensor. Just as with the Honor 7X, the smaller secondary sensor is there purely to provide depth information for the included wide aperture and portrait modes.Honor 9 Lite     Battery lifeThe Honor 9 Lite comes with a 3000mAh battery, which is pretty typical for a phone of this size. It   s a little smaller than the 3340mAh battery of the similarly specced Honor 7X, but that phone has a larger and more demanding 6-inch display.Perhaps as a result, Honor claims that you can get an extra hour of offline video watching out of the Honor 9 Lite   s battery (13 hours rather than 12). In practice, we found that it ate through a similar amount of battery (14%) when watching a 50-minute downloaded TV programme with the screen brightness bumped right up, which isn   t great.Why buy the Honor 9 Lite?The Honor 9 Lite offers a number of strong features for a 13,000 price tag. Its all-screen design is something we still aren   t used to seeing at this price point, while general performance is reasonably snappyScore    Performance7    Camera7    Design7    Battery Life6    Value8    Software5    Calls & Sound7    Screen Quality8VerdictThe Honor 9 Lite   s bezel-light design and twin-lens camera tricks are eye catching, but it   s perhaps too quirky to fully take on the Motorola G-series at the top of the table.Honor 9 Lite (3 GB 32 GB) Blue', '0 users found this review helpful'], ['Waste of money...dont buy this phn...mi is much better than this', '0 users found this review helpful'], ['Very nice prodect ..', '0 users found this review helpful'], [""There's no headset in the box"", '0 users found this review helpful'], ['Weight less and good battery back up and speedy....', '0 users found this review helpful'], ['Worst camera..

Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.           "", '8 users found this review helpful'], ['Everything is good in phone like camera and display.

Fans of the brand praise these lenses for blowing life into photos. When describing excellent lenses we use phrase like “high permeability” or sentence like “capture the sense of airiness in the picture.” High permeability here is easily understood while “airiness” takes time to come across. nAiriness refers to unparalleled resolution and restoration capability that Leica lens possesses.nLeica lens captures micro details in dark areas, with no overexposure in bright areas, and presents richer and smoother color saturation, bring airiness to photos. nLeica uses low-contrast lens, giving photos more details in tonal value. An additional advantage of shooting with a Leica is that there’s more room for editing even though in the same RAW format. Leica RAW format photos have greater tolerance than RAW photos shot by any other brand’s camera on the market, hence greater color range to adjust in post-production.nLeica lens’ color performance and capability to suppress high brightness gives photos richer details and greater color saturation. By reducing the high brightness, Leica lens captures richer colors than human eye. The optics and coating technologies of Leica lens ensures greater light control, thus details can be preserved and photos are more color dynamic.nP9 features the Summarit camera lenses from Leica, subject to stringent quality screening by engineers at Leica in accordance with the most demanding quality criterion. nTOP 2: Leica Picture Quality: Clarity, Details, Color & SNRnRGB camera (color) is for recording color information, and the monochrome camera (mono) is for capturing silhouettes and details in high resolution. The light sensitivity and resolving power of monochrome camera are superior due to the absence of color filter.

I would personally don't recommend buying 4GB variant phone. Likes:1. Display is very good at this price range2. Bluetooth output is good3. Call reception is good4. RAM management is very good, I compared against some other phones, I can say Samsung has done a very good job. I an not seeing applications getting reloaded.5. Camera output is pretty sharp, images are pretty good.6. Battery life is great, It easily lasts one day with 100% charge. And the rate of charging is pretty good.Dislikes:1. Phone isn't very responsive, if you search anything in settings app, for the first time it usually takes more than 3 seconds to search.2. We can easily notice lagginess in the app switch animation. I have even tried stopping all animations to check the responsiveness, but it didn't help.3. Speaker output is ain't great but we can manage.4. In past week I have seen screen freezing issue a few times. All of a sudden facerecognition animation started showing at the bottom of the screen.5. Biggest disappointment is fingerprint scanner, most of the times it won't work. Whenever it works, it takes its own time(and it ain't consistent). I personally got frustrated with this unlocking mechanism, I switched to face and pattern recognition. I would have been happy if they had provided capacitive fingerprint scanner. Even after the recent update, it didn't help much, yes, now the rate of successful detection is high but still fails most of the times.To conclude,I was using MI 5(with Sd820) and it lasted for 3 years. I wanted another budget phone which can last 3 years(I don't wanted to buy mi), so went ahead with Samsung, but looking at it's performance i can say it won't last for 3 years. I personally wouldn't recommend buying this phone. Consider all the factors and make your decision, as we will be using it for at least 2-3 years.

Also, it wasn't available at the time of purchase. The phone looks cool, is feature rich and I loved the wide angle option in triple camera sensors.

Face recognition is snail paced compared to the one in POCO. The innovative inscreen fingerprint recognition is slower and sometimes does not read as well. In terms of gaming I play Pubg and it is choppy and slower. I thought Chinese Xiaomi had more bloatwares among all, but I was wrong till I used Samsung.

Rest is yours.Also, Out of 4GB, 2.5 GB is taken by system and apps in Ram section. This does not effect much.2)Front Camera-> It's good, Samsung should work on this. Personally, I didn't like very much, the selfie from this phone. We can't complaint at this price. But, It is what it is. Although, It's not bad.

Honor calls its approach FullView, which basically refers to devices with a higher screen-to-device ratio.Honor 9 Lite     ScreenMaking the front of your phone even more about the display than usual places extra pressure on the quality of the screen itself. Thankfully, the Honor 9 Lite isn   t found wanting in this respect.This is a nicely sized 5.65-inch IPS LCD screen, with decent viewing angles, contrast and strong brightness when you need to crank things up. You   d need to spend considerably more money to find something much better. Meanwhile, a 2160 x 1080 (FHD+) resolution ensures that individual pixels can   t be picked out, to the tune of 428ppi.Honor 9 Lite     PerformanceOne of the reasons Honor phones can often appear to offer more features than many of their budget rivals is because they have access to the cheaper processors of HiSilicon, which is owned by parent company Huawei.In the Honor 9 Lite   s case this means the 2.36GHz Kirin 659 CPU, which is the same chip that powers both the Honor 7X and the Huawei P Smart. It   s accompanied by 3GB of RAM, which is 1GB less than the 7X.The Kirin 659 is a lower-mid-range chip that appears to sit in the middle of Qualcomm   s entry-level offerings. An average Geekbench 4 multicore score of 3644 pitches the Honor 9 Lite well below the slightly more expensive Moto G5S Plus (with its Snapdragon 625) on 4460, but well above the similarly priced Moto G5S (packing a Snapdragon 430) on 2294Honor 9 Lite     SoftwareJust like the similarly specced Huawei P Smart, the Honor 9 Lite runs the latest version of Google   s mobile OS, Android 8.0 Oreo. This is a good thing.Honor 9 Lite     CameraRather impressively for a budget phone, Honor has managed to follow the Honor 9 and Honor 7X and equip the Honor 9 Lite with a dual camera setup. In fact, it   s gone one step further and provided a similar provision for selfies.Both the front and rear of the device play host to one 13-megapixel and one 2-megapixel sensor. Just as with the Honor 7X, the smaller secondary sensor is there purely to provide depth information for the included wide aperture and portrait modes.Honor 9 Lite     Battery lifeThe Honor 9 Lite comes with a 3000mAh battery, which is pretty typical for a phone of this size. It   s a little smaller than the 3340mAh battery of the similarly specced Honor 7X, but that phone has a larger and more demanding 6-inch display.Perhaps as a result, Honor claims that you can get an extra hour of offline video watching out of the Honor 9 Lite   s battery (13 hours rather than 12). In practice, we found that it ate through a similar amount of battery (14%) when watching a 50-minute downloaded TV programme with the screen brightness bumped right up, which isn   t great.Why buy the Honor 9 Lite?The Honor 9 Lite offers a number of strong features for a 13,000 price tag.

Action camera is not tested enough to give a review. Though photos can't be clicked using Wide angle camera but while using it for taking video you can use the option of screenshot button to click photos. \n4) Performance is fast and smooth enough for doing all the day to day works.\n5) USB type-c port, it's pretty useful these days.\n6) Speaker is at the bottom and decent enough.\nNEUTRALS:-\n1)21:9 aspect ratio-it looks good when you play a supportive video but most of the time you'll find it useless bcoz maximum videos are not available in this aspect ratio including YT, Hotstar, Prime Video etc.\n2) Hardware- Backside is glossy plastic and it can't be used without the silicon cover provided with it or any other similar back over.\nCONS:-\n1)Battery backup is woefully low in comparison with any other similar device.. atleast 4000mAH battery is basic. If you are staying outdoor for long hours you have to keep powerbank with you. Also the charger provided with the phone is a slow charger not a turbo or fast charger, it take ages to charge the device specially if you are in a hurry.\n2) Display is the second most disappointing issue in this phone. You have to increase the brightness to atleast 40% -50% to be able to see anything in daylight. Also normal 15% 20% brightness is pretty dark and not suitable for watching movies or anything unlike other similar devices.\n3)Big round notch in the front screen for front camera looks very very ugly. it should have been much smaller. Due to this notch it's very hard to get a proper tampered glass for this phone.\n4) Gaming is not much tested in this phone but from whatever I played (NOT PUBG) though it handled well but device gets very hot in short period of time also you have to keep the graphics to low/medium for best results. So if you are planning to play Pubg look for other device not this one. Also the big camera notch is very problematic while gaming.\n5)Very difficult to reach contents which are in top of the screen as most of the time top notification bar will come down.\nFINAL WORD:\nIf you have budget of less than 15K and not an avid gamer this phone is made for you. Not only it has Google's Android One version also 128gb storage device under 15K is impossible to find. With few cons I'll still recommend this device just for the price.\nPlease give a like if you find this helpful!

It's going to be a bit lengthy so please have patience.\n\nThose who are looking for a short answer - Just go for it without a second thought (but be careful).\n\nIf you are reading this then the chances are you might be confused between one plus 7 and 6z. Let me just fractionize the pros and cons with details.\n\nWhy I chose this device over OP7.\n\n1. Better battery backup.\n2. The secondary camera in OP7 is a depth sensor on the other hand 6z has a wide-angle aperture.\n3. Infinity Display (not everyone's choice).\n4. Durability (It survived many drop tests against OP7).\n5. Your main camera is your selfie camera (so great clarity).\n\nPros.\n\n1. Great Camera, hands down to that. Low light photos have some grains but much better than OP7.\n2. I was a bit skeptical about the flip camera but since it is made with the liquid metal it's more durable than you think.\n3. Infinite Display.\n4. Powered by snapdragon 855 offering awesome speed and smoothness.\n5. Navigation is superb just love the smoothness.\n6. Even though it runs on zen UI 6, you will not see any bloatware like Mi (I hate MiUI). Stock android like feeling with some additional features. \n7. GPU is Adreno 640, making games like PUBG and COD buttery-smooth (back might get warm after a while but it's common with every device, even with Samsung S10 and iPhone 11).\n7.  HDR 10 + (will speak about this in the latter part).\n8. The front is protected with Gorilla glass 6 and back with Gorilla Glass 3.\n9. Customizable function button (I am using it for torch).\n10. 600 Nits of luminosity (in simple terms awesome daylight readability). FYI, iPhone 11 has 610 Nits.\n11. Massive battery 5000 mAh. (Now it might look like your battery is draining fast but with moderate use, it will last for a day and a half.). To conserve more battery you have to stop playing around with the flip camera as it runs on a motor and motor consumes a lot of power.\n12. Plus point, a headphone jack with and high res earphone. (By the way, a good High res earphone comes around 2k).\n13. Awesome sound especially through earphones. Now I am Dolby Atmos guy and I had my doubts with DTS X, but it turned out to be amazing.\n14. Dedicated memory slot expandable up to 2 TB.\n15. Physical fingerprint sensor (I trust this more than in display).\n\nNow the cons.\n\n1. Its IPS LCD and not AMOLED (Now this has HDR 10+ which means the colors and display is as good as Amoled, plus no dead pixels like AMOLED. I think that's why Apple is sticking with LCD's).\n2. No in-display fingerprint (for some people it is a con).\n3. No  IP rating (but can handle some splashes).\n4. Even though Asus claims it has stereo speakers but the earpiece acting as a secondary speaker is not as good as OP7. It's more muffled and too low.\n5. Bit heavy and bulky 201g to be precise (but fits really well in hand).\n6. No depth sensor (Hey, what else you need in 28k).\n7. No pre-applied screen protection (But GG6).\n8. Since its flip camera, you can't take selfies while the phone is on a flat surface. But the camera is auto-retractable if it experiences some hurdle.\n\nNow you might ask Nikhil if the pros look like pros and the cons look like pros; what's the problem, why 3 star?\n\nNot everything with the device is roses and rainbows.\n\nThis device has a problem (not every device but mine has). I first noticed this on the second day, when I kept my phone to charge. The device rebooted itself and I wasn't even using it. At first, I thought it might be a glitch because not every device is perfect. Then the same thing happened again when I was scrolling through Instagram. The screen froze and restarted. \n\nYesterday  I was in my office and the phone was beside me, again the same thing happened, an auto reboot. Then I thought this thing is serious and I googled about the same and came to know that I am not the only one who is facing this issue. Even the negative reviews over here are filled with the same. When I spoke with ASUS representative he told me that this is a hardware issue and I have to go for a replacement.\n\nBefore that, I thought its just a glitch and can easily be resolved with an OTA update but things went south. Sadly you can't tell whether your device is faulty or not but you can run few tests to determine the same.\n\n1. Play high-end games like PUBG or COD for at least 60 minutes.\n2. Or download the Antutu app from playstore and do a stress test.\n\nIf any these test fails or your system restarts then it's faulty. As of now, my device is under the return process but it's a bit hard over here. They rejected the request 2 times. Has a window till 7 Nov. Hoping for the best.\n\nSorry, I didn't take any images to post.\n\nIf you still have doubts go with OP7 you will not regret it.\n\nHappy shopping.

Its probably only in silver model.\nThe camera options automatically pops up in apps which use camera (camscanner,whatsapp, etc) , but it takes few seconds to flip the camera.\nPlastic back cover is stiff and very hard to remove.\nSlo-mo video is too dark when set at high frame rate (screen shot attached )\nScreen display software is not up to mark , need to change the brightness manually some times for better viewing.\nSince the camera auto retracts when it feels like its gonna falls, we cannot make selfie videos while paragliding :-\\\nI tried making selfie video and shook my phone downwards , and it retracted back to rear camera.', '2 users found this review helpful'], [""Asus 6z dead after receiving . not charging, can't switch on...

This is my 3rd asus phone. I really like asus phones because of thier features they bringing each time on thier new phones. This time obviously the flip camera. Definitely redefining ordinary phones. After a long wait finally i got this phone in 26000rs during this big billion days. :)\nA quick comparison with new one plus 7 is - it don't have that liquid cooling feature which is somewhat helpful if you are a big game lover. I played pubg in this phone, it's heating little bit. But not like hot pan like heat. And not completely water resistant like oneplus. Other than this i didn't feel any other major draw backs when compared with oneplus. But have more common features like radio, microphone jack etc.\nCamera is really good. Low light photos could have been little more better. May be with upcomming update s this may solve. Battery life is really good. Fast charging is really helpfull to fill this 5000mah massive battery very quickly. \nThe main missing factor in this phone when i compare with my zenphone 3 is Asus's kids mode. That was really helpful for parent like me. And adaptive sensor need some adjustments which also required some improvement and it's little heavy because of that massive battery. If you are watching movies by holding in your hand, you may feel pain. But again it's not a big issue. My Zenfone 3 was so light.\nOther than these this is really a super nice solid phone guys. With lot of other Asus's good customized features and this time they brought near stock android ui. That's also awesome. Asus's customized features and Google features made this phone really incredible.\n Don't under estimate asus. They are really far far better than other cheap but high features offered phone available in today's indian market. Believe me it will not disappoint you.

The choice was to be made between this and the similarly priced Oneplus 7, but I chose the 6z for the features it was offering at the same price point. The main thing that turned me off from me purchasing was the fact the Oneplus 7 missed the headphone jack and I am not really a fan of Bluetooth headsets. So, I decided to buy this device in the flash sale that took place. \n\nMy initial impressions regarding that device were rather good. I was drawn into the flip camera the most since it really offered some cool ways in which one could make use of the mobile camera. The performance of the device was also pretty neat with all the games running smoothly. But after 2 months of the purchase, the device started to behave abruptly. It started restarting on its own randomly and sometimes it turns itself off and won't start. After an hour or so I tried again to boot the device and I was successful this time which left me a bit confused on why didn't start earlier. On researching in the Asus forums, I found out that it was not only me who was facing this issue but a bunch of other people were also facing the same issue, which supposedly is related to some hardware problem. \n\nHighly disappointed by Asus, that such a reputed company can come out with a flagship having hardware problems. I seriously doubt that I will ever buy another Asus smartphone."", '1 users found this review helpful'], ['Writing this review after usage  of 2 weeks & facing horrible experience initially.\n.\nWithin first hour of usage my phone crashed 3 times & next day again few times giving me jitters . I recorded the restarts/crashes through other phone as proof. I requested replacement in haste as I had heard the restart/crash issue with this phone before buying but without any resolution mentioned anywhere. Flipkart supported me & from Asus/Seller side third party agent was sent to inspect the phone. As expected phone behaved normally during inspection/restart. The agent left saying he saw some issues & assuring case will be forwarded. He however gave clean cheat & I received message from seller stating my replacement request cannot be processed. Annoyed I made few calls to Flipkart ,where representatives helped me again to take up the case. Again Seller sent 2nd agent for inspection. This agent also did not find issue but found another upgrade was just available on my phone. He just upgraded the phone. He did not note any issue in phone as expected again. I had already found 2 upgraded earlier & I completed them but still issue persisted. After this upgrade the crashes/restart stopped. I tested the phone thoroughly  for audio,video,net connection & all aspects , but found everything satisfactory.\n\n   Those were scary days for me as 26K new phone was behaving like corrupt & it was recorded well in Asus foum, Flipkart reviews. This is something Asus should have handled before certifying/dispatching the product. Total 3 upgrades took 700+MBs of space.\n\nMy observations,\n - Camera quality is good as mentioned everywhere here. Same 48MP front & back side. I did not test night quality much.\n - Battery backup is excellent. Charging of 30 min gives initial 40+% recharge. Quite fast & little bit of heating but after initial heating I did not sense same.\n - Screen quality is OK , may not be like A50/A70 Amoled display but not bad at all\n- Speaker volume is good enough , did not see any call quality issue.\n- Body is strong material but back cover is simple plastic\n- Sim tray is very delicate ,have to be careful while inserting back\n-  After start I could see 3GB of free Memory of the 5.8 GB available for use.

So, no complaint in that department. I know its a bit early to write a review, but believe me, I spent a month to decide between One Plus 7 and Asus 6z. \n\nSo let's get started. It's going to be a bit lengthy so please have patience.\n\nThose who are looking for a short answer - Just go for it without a second thought (but be careful).\n\nIf you are reading this then the chances are you might be confused between one plus 7 and 6z. Let me just fractionize the pros and cons with details.\n\nWhy I chose this device over OP7.\n\n1. Better battery backup.\n2. The secondary camera in OP7 is a depth sensor on the other hand 6z has a wide-angle aperture.\n3. Infinity Display (not everyone's choice).\n4. Durability (It survived many drop tests against OP7).\n5. Your main camera is your selfie camera (so great clarity).\n\nPros.\n\n1. Great Camera, hands down to that. Low light photos have some grains but much better than OP7.\n2. I was a bit skeptical about the flip camera but since it is made with the liquid metal it's more durable than you think.\n3. Infinite Display.\n4. Powered by snapdragon 855 offering awesome speed and smoothness.\n5. Navigation is superb just love the smoothness.\n6. Even though it runs on zen UI 6, you will not see any bloatware like Mi (I hate MiUI). Stock android like feeling with some additional features. \n7. GPU is Adreno 640, making games like PUBG and COD buttery-smooth (back might get warm after a while but it's common with every device, even with Samsung S10 and iPhone 11).\n7.  HDR 10 + (will speak about this in the latter part).\n8. The front is protected with Gorilla glass 6 and back with Gorilla Glass 3.\n9. Customizable function button (I am using it for torch).\n10. 600 Nits of luminosity (in simple terms awesome daylight readability). FYI, iPhone 11 has 610 Nits.\n11. Massive battery 5000 mAh. (Now it might look like your battery is draining fast but with moderate use, it will last for a day and a half.). To conserve more battery you have to stop playing around with the flip camera as it runs on a motor and motor consumes a lot of power.\n12. Plus point, a headphone jack with and high res earphone. (By the way, a good High res earphone comes around 2k).\n13. Awesome sound especially through earphones. Now I am Dolby Atmos guy and I had my doubts with DTS X, but it turned out to be amazing.\n14. Dedicated memory slot expandable up to 2 TB.\n15. Physical fingerprint sensor (I trust this more than in display).\n\nNow the cons.\n\n1. Its IPS LCD and not AMOLED (Now this has HDR 10+ which means the colors and display is as good as Amoled, plus no dead pixels like AMOLED. I think that's why Apple is sticking with LCD's).\n2. No in-display fingerprint (for some people it is a con).\n3. No  IP rating (but can handle some splashes).\n4. Even though Asus claims it has stereo speakers but the earpiece acting as a secondary speaker is not as good as OP7. It's more muffled and too low.\n5. Bit heavy and bulky 201g to be precise (but fits really well in hand).\n6. No depth sensor (Hey, what else you need in 28k).\n7. No pre-applied screen protection (But GG6).\n8. Since its flip camera, you can't take selfies while the phone is on a flat surface. But the camera is auto-retractable if it experiences some hurdle.\n\nNow you might ask Nikhil if the pros look like pros and the cons look like pros; what's the problem, why 3 star?\n\nNot everything with the device is roses and rainbows.\n\nThis device has a problem (not every device but mine has). I first noticed this on the second day, when I kept my phone to charge. The device rebooted itself and I wasn't even using it. At first, I thought it might be a glitch because not every device is perfect. Then the same thing happened again when I was scrolling through Instagram. The screen froze and restarted. \n\nYesterday  I was in my office and the phone was beside me, again the same thing happened, an auto reboot. Then I thought this thing is serious and I googled about the same and came to know that I am not the only one who is facing this issue. Even the negative reviews over here are filled with the same. When I spoke with ASUS representative he told me that this is a hardware issue and I have to go for a replacement.\n\nBefore that, I thought its just a glitch and can easily be resolved with an OTA update but things went south. Sadly you can't tell whether your device is faulty or not but you can run few tests to determine the same.\n\n1. Play high-end games like PUBG or COD for at least 60 minutes.\n2. Or download the Antutu app from playstore and do a stress test.\n\nIf any these test fails or your system restarts then it's faulty. As of now, my device is under the return process but it's a bit hard over here. They rejected the request 2 times. Has a window till 7 Nov. Hoping for the best.\n\nSorry, I didn't take any images to post.\n\nIf you still have doubts go with OP7 you will not regret it.\n\nHappy shopping.

After a long wait finally i got this phone in 26000rs during this big billion days. :)\nA quick comparison with new one plus 7 is - it don't have that liquid cooling feature which is somewhat helpful if you are a big game lover. I played pubg in this phone, it's heating little bit. But not like hot pan like heat. And not completely water resistant like oneplus. Other than this i didn't feel any other major draw backs when compared with oneplus. But have more common features like radio, microphone jack etc.\nCamera is really good. Low light photos could have been little more better. May be with upcomming update s this may solve. Battery life is really good. Fast charging is really helpfull to fill this 5000mah massive battery very quickly. \nThe main missing factor in this phone when i compare with my zenphone 3 is Asus's kids mode. That was really helpful for parent like me. And adaptive sensor need some adjustments which also required some improvement and it's little heavy because of that massive battery. If you are watching movies by holding in your hand, you may feel pain. But again it's not a big issue. My Zenfone 3 was so light.\nOther than these this is really a super nice solid phone guys.

Flipkart supported me & from Asus/Seller side third party agent was sent to inspect the phone. As expected phone behaved normally during inspection/restart. The agent left saying he saw some issues & assuring case will be forwarded. He however gave clean cheat & I received message from seller stating my replacement request cannot be processed. Annoyed I made few calls to Flipkart ,where representatives helped me again to take up the case. Again Seller sent 2nd agent for inspection. This agent also did not find issue but found another upgrade was just available on my phone. He just upgraded the phone. He did not note any issue in phone as expected again. I had already found 2 upgraded earlier & I completed them but still issue persisted. After this upgrade the crashes/restart stopped. I tested the phone thoroughly  for audio,video,net connection & all aspects , but found everything satisfactory.\n\n   Those were scary days for me as 26K new phone was behaving like corrupt & it was recorded well in Asus foum, Flipkart reviews. This is something Asus should have handled before certifying/dispatching the product. Total 3 upgrades took 700+MBs of space.\n\nMy observations,\n - Camera quality is good as mentioned everywhere here. Same 48MP front & back side. I did not test night quality much.\n - Battery backup is excellent. Charging of 30 min gives initial 40+% recharge. Quite fast & little bit of heating but after initial heating I did not sense same.\n - Screen quality is OK , may not be like A50/A70 Amoled display but not bad at all\n- Speaker volume is good enough , did not see any call quality issue.\n- Body is strong material but back cover is simple plastic\n- Sim tray is very delicate ,have to be careful while inserting back\n-  After start I could see 3GB of free Memory of the 5.8 GB available for use. However now I am seeing less than 1 GB available although I am using less applications.\n- No unnecessary applications provided like Samsung phones\n\nOverall worth a buy but definitely somewhat expensive.', '1 users found this review helpful'], ['gud performance', '1 users found this review helpful'], ['cool product', '1 users found this review helpful'], ['ASUS LOVER 😍♥️', '1 users found this review helpful'], ['If you are a normal user then go for 6/64 variant.

So, no complaint in that department. I know its a bit early to write a review, but believe me, I spent a month to decide between One Plus 7 and Asus 6z. \n\nSo let's get started. It's going to be a bit lengthy so please have patience.\n\nThose who are looking for a short answer - Just go for it without a second thought (but be careful).\n\nIf you are reading this then the chances are you might be confused between one plus 7 and 6z. Let me just fractionize the pros and cons with details.\n\nWhy I chose this device over OP7.\n\n1. Better battery backup.\n2. The secondary camera in OP7 is a depth sensor on the other hand 6z has a wide-angle aperture.\n3. Infinity Display (not everyone's choice).\n4. Durability (It survived many drop tests against OP7).\n5. Your main camera is your selfie camera (so great clarity).\n\nPros.\n\n1. Great Camera, hands down to that. Low light photos have some grains but much better than OP7.\n2. I was a bit skeptical about the flip camera but since it is made with the liquid metal it's more durable than you think.\n3. Infinite Display.\n4. Powered by snapdragon 855 offering awesome speed and smoothness.\n5. Navigation is superb just love the smoothness.\n6. Even though it runs on zen UI 6, you will not see any bloatware like Mi (I hate MiUI). Stock android like feeling with some additional features. \n7. GPU is Adreno 640, making games like PUBG and COD buttery-smooth (back might get warm after a while but it's common with every device, even with Samsung S10 and iPhone 11).\n7.  HDR 10 + (will speak about this in the latter part).\n8. The front is protected with Gorilla glass 6 and back with Gorilla Glass 3.\n9. Customizable function button (I am using it for torch).\n10. 600 Nits of luminosity (in simple terms awesome daylight readability). FYI, iPhone 11 has 610 Nits.\n11. Massive battery 5000 mAh. (Now it might look like your battery is draining fast but with moderate use, it will last for a day and a half.). To conserve more battery you have to stop playing around with the flip camera as it runs on a motor and motor consumes a lot of power.\n12. Plus point, a headphone jack with and high res earphone. (By the way, a good High res earphone comes around 2k).\n13. Awesome sound especially through earphones. Now I am Dolby Atmos guy and I had my doubts with DTS X, but it turned out to be amazing.\n14. Dedicated memory slot expandable up to 2 TB.\n15. Physical fingerprint sensor (I trust this more than in display).\n\nNow the cons.\n\n1. Its IPS LCD and not AMOLED (Now this has HDR 10+ which means the colors and display is as good as Amoled, plus no dead pixels like AMOLED. I think that's why Apple is sticking with LCD's).\n2. No in-display fingerprint (for some people it is a con).\n3. No  IP rating (but can handle some splashes).\n4. Even though Asus claims it has stereo speakers but the earpiece acting as a secondary speaker is not as good as OP7. It's more muffled and too low.\n5. Bit heavy and bulky 201g to be precise (but fits really well in hand).\n6. No depth sensor (Hey, what else you need in 28k).\n7. No pre-applied screen protection (But GG6).\n8. Since its flip camera, you can't take selfies while the phone is on a flat surface. But the camera is auto-retractable if it experiences some hurdle.\n\nNow you might ask Nikhil if the pros look like pros and the cons look like pros; what's the problem, why 3 star?\n\nNot everything with the device is roses and rainbows.\n\nThis device has a problem (not every device but mine has). I first noticed this on the second day, when I kept my phone to charge. The device rebooted itself and I wasn't even using it. At first, I thought it might be a glitch because not every device is perfect. Then the same thing happened again when I was scrolling through Instagram. The screen froze and restarted. \n\nYesterday  I was in my office and the phone was beside me, again the same thing happened, an auto reboot. Then I thought this thing is serious and I googled about the same and came to know that I am not the only one who is facing this issue. Even the negative reviews over here are filled with the same. When I spoke with ASUS representative he told me that this is a hardware issue and I have to go for a replacement.\n\nBefore that, I thought its just a glitch and can easily be resolved with an OTA update but things went south. Sadly you can't tell whether your device is faulty or not but you can run few tests to determine the same.\n\n1. Play high-end games like PUBG or COD for at least 60 minutes.\n2. Or download the Antutu app from playstore and do a stress test.\n\nIf any these test fails or your system restarts then it's faulty. As of now, my device is under the return process but it's a bit hard over here. They rejected the request 2 times. Has a window till 7 Nov. Hoping for the best.\n\nSorry, I didn't take any images to post.\n\nIf you still have doubts go with OP7 you will not regret it.\n\nHappy shopping.

After a long wait finally i got this phone in 26000rs during this big billion days. :)\nA quick comparison with new one plus 7 is - it don't have that liquid cooling feature which is somewhat helpful if you are a big game lover. I played pubg in this phone, it's heating little bit. But not like hot pan like heat. And not completely water resistant like oneplus. Other than this i didn't feel any other major draw backs when compared with oneplus. But have more common features like radio, microphone jack etc.\nCamera is really good. Low light photos could have been little more better. May be with upcomming update s this may solve. Battery life is really good. Fast charging is really helpfull to fill this 5000mah massive battery very quickly. \nThe main missing factor in this phone when i compare with my zenphone 3 is Asus's kids mode. That was really helpful for parent like me. And adaptive sensor need some adjustments which also required some improvement and it's little heavy because of that massive battery. If you are watching movies by holding in your hand, you may feel pain. But again it's not a big issue. My Zenfone 3 was so light.\nOther than these this is really a super nice solid phone guys.

It started restarting on its own randomly and sometimes it turns itself off and won't start.

Let me just fractionize the pros and cons with details.\n\nWhy I chose this device over OP7.\n\n1. Better battery backup.\n2. The secondary camera in OP7 is a depth sensor on the other hand 6z has a wide-angle aperture.\n3. Infinity Display (not everyone's choice).\n4. Durability (It survived many drop tests against OP7).\n5. Your main camera is your selfie camera (so great clarity).\n\nPros.\n\n1. Great Camera, hands down to that. Low light photos have some grains but much better than OP7.\n2. I was a bit skeptical about the flip camera but since it is made with the liquid metal it's more durable than you think.\n3. Infinite Display.\n4. Powered by snapdragon 855 offering awesome speed and smoothness.\n5. Navigation is superb just love the smoothness.\n6. Even though it runs on zen UI 6, you will not see any bloatware like Mi (I hate MiUI). Stock android like feeling with some additional features. \n7. GPU is Adreno 640, making games like PUBG and COD buttery-smooth (back might get warm after a while but it's common with every device, even with Samsung S10 and iPhone 11).\n7.  HDR 10 + (will speak about this in the latter part).\n8. The front is protected with Gorilla glass 6 and back with Gorilla Glass 3.\n9. Customizable function button (I am using it for torch).\n10. 600 Nits of luminosity (in simple terms awesome daylight readability). FYI, iPhone 11 has 610 Nits.\n11. Massive battery 5000 mAh. (Now it might look like your battery is draining fast but with moderate use, it will last for a day and a half.). To conserve more battery you have to stop playing around with the flip camera as it runs on a motor and motor consumes a lot of power.\n12. Plus point, a headphone jack with and high res earphone. (By the way, a good High res earphone comes around 2k).\n13. Awesome sound especially through earphones. Now I am Dolby Atmos guy and I had my doubts with DTS X, but it turned out to be amazing.\n14. Dedicated memory slot expandable up to 2 TB.\n15. Physical fingerprint sensor (I trust this more than in display).\n\nNow the cons.\n\n1. Its IPS LCD and not AMOLED (Now this has HDR 10+ which means the colors and display is as good as Amoled, plus no dead pixels like AMOLED. I think that's why Apple is sticking with LCD's).\n2. No in-display fingerprint (for some people it is a con).\n3. No  IP rating (but can handle some splashes).\n4. Even though Asus claims it has stereo speakers but the earpiece acting as a secondary speaker is not as good as OP7. It's more muffled and too low.\n5. Bit heavy and bulky 201g to be precise (but fits really well in hand).\n6. No depth sensor (Hey, what else you need in 28k).\n7. No pre-applied screen protection (But GG6).\n8. Since its flip camera, you can't take selfies while the phone is on a flat surface. But the camera is auto-retractable if it experiences some hurdle.\n\nNow you might ask Nikhil if the pros look like pros and the cons look like pros; what's the problem, why 3 star?\n\nNot everything with the device is roses and rainbows.\n\nThis device has a problem (not every device but mine has). I first noticed this on the second day, when I kept my phone to charge. The device rebooted itself and I wasn't even using it. At first, I thought it might be a glitch because not every device is perfect. Then the same thing happened again when I was scrolling through Instagram. The screen froze and restarted. \n\nYesterday  I was in my office and the phone was beside me, again the same thing happened, an auto reboot. Then I thought this thing is serious and I googled about the same and came to know that I am not the only one who is facing this issue. Even the negative reviews over here are filled with the same. When I spoke with ASUS representative he told me that this is a hardware issue and I have to go for a replacement.\n\nBefore that, I thought its just a glitch and can easily be resolved with an OTA update but things went south. Sadly you can't tell whether your device is faulty or not but you can run few tests to determine the same.\n\n1. Play high-end games like PUBG or COD for at least 60 minutes.\n2. Or download the Antutu app from playstore and do a stress test.\n\nIf any these test fails or your system restarts then it's faulty. As of now, my device is under the return process but it's a bit hard over here. They rejected the request 2 times. Has a window till 7 Nov. Hoping for the best.\n\nSorry, I didn't take any images to post.\n\nIf you still have doubts go with OP7 you will not regret it.\n\nHappy shopping.

This is my 3rd asus phone. I really like asus phones because of thier features they bringing each time on thier new phones. This time obviously the flip camera. Definitely redefining ordinary phones. After a long wait finally i got this phone in 26000rs during this big billion days. :)\nA quick comparison with new one plus 7 is - it don't have that liquid cooling feature which is somewhat helpful if you are a big game lover. I played pubg in this phone, it's heating little bit. But not like hot pan like heat. And not completely water resistant like oneplus. Other than this i didn't feel any other major draw backs when compared with oneplus. But have more common features like radio, microphone jack etc.\nCamera is really good. Low light photos could have been little more better. May be with upcomming update s this may solve. Battery life is really good. Fast charging is really helpfull to fill this 5000mah massive battery very quickly. \nThe main missing factor in this phone when i compare with my zenphone 3 is Asus's kids mode. That was really helpful for parent like me. And adaptive sensor need some adjustments which also required some improvement and it's little heavy because of that massive battery. If you are watching movies by holding in your hand, you may feel pain. But again it's not a big issue. My Zenfone 3 was so light.\nOther than these this is really a super nice solid phone guys. With lot of other Asus's good customized features and this time they brought near stock android ui. That's also awesome. Asus's customized features and Google features made this phone really incredible.\n Don't under estimate asus.

The choice was to be made between this and the similarly priced Oneplus 7, but I chose the 6z for the features it was offering at the same price point. The main thing that turned me off from me purchasing was the fact the Oneplus 7 missed the headphone jack and I am not really a fan of Bluetooth headsets. So, I decided to buy this device in the flash sale that took place. \n\nMy initial impressions regarding that device were rather good. I was drawn into the flip camera the most since it really offered some cool ways in which one could make use of the mobile camera. The performance of the device was also pretty neat with all the games running smoothly. But after 2 months of the purchase, the device started to behave abruptly. It started restarting on its own randomly and sometimes it turns itself off and won't start. After an hour or so I tried again to boot the device and I was successful this time which left me a bit confused on why didn't start earlier. On researching in the Asus forums, I found out that it was not only me who was facing this issue but a bunch of other people were also facing the same issue, which supposedly is related to some hardware problem. \n\nHighly disappointed by Asus, that such a reputed company can come out with a flagship having hardware problems.

I recorded the restarts/crashes through other phone as proof. I requested replacement in haste as I had heard the restart/crash issue with this phone before buying but without any resolution mentioned anywhere. Flipkart supported me & from Asus/Seller side third party agent was sent to inspect the phone. As expected phone behaved normally during inspection/restart. The agent left saying he saw some issues & assuring case will be forwarded. He however gave clean cheat & I received message from seller stating my replacement request cannot be processed. Annoyed I made few calls to Flipkart ,where representatives helped me again to take up the case. Again Seller sent 2nd agent for inspection. This agent also did not find issue but found another upgrade was just available on my phone. He just upgraded the phone. He did not note any issue in phone as expected again. I had already found 2 upgraded earlier & I completed them but still issue persisted. After this upgrade the crashes/restart stopped. I tested the phone thoroughly  for audio,video,net connection & all aspects , but found everything satisfactory.\n\n   Those were scary days for me as 26K new phone was behaving like corrupt & it was recorded well in Asus foum, Flipkart reviews. This is something Asus should have handled before certifying/dispatching the product. Total 3 upgrades took 700+MBs of space.\n\nMy observations,\n - Camera quality is good as mentioned everywhere here. Same 48MP front & back side. I did not test night quality much.\n - Battery backup is excellent. Charging of 30 min gives initial 40+% recharge. Quite fast & little bit of heating but after initial heating I did not sense same.\n - Screen quality is OK , may not be like A50/A70 Amoled display but not bad at all\n- Speaker volume is good enough , did not see any call quality issue.\n- Body is strong material but back cover is simple plastic\n- Sim tray is very delicate ,have to be careful while inserting back\n-  After start I could see 3GB of free Memory of the 5.8 GB available for use.

RAM management is very good, I compared against some other phones, I can say Samsung has done a very good job. I an not seeing applications getting reloaded.5. Camera output is pretty sharp, images are pretty good.6. Battery life is great, It easily lasts one day with 100% charge. And the rate of charging is pretty good.Dislikes:1. Phone isn't very responsive, if you search anything in settings app, for the first time it usually takes more than 3 seconds to search.2. We can easily notice lagginess in the app switch animation. I have even tried stopping all animations to check the responsiveness, but it didn't help.3. Speaker output is ain't great but we can manage.4. In past week I have seen screen freezing issue a few times. All of a sudden facerecognition animation started showing at the bottom of the screen.5. Biggest disappointment is fingerprint scanner, most of the times it won't work. Whenever it works, it takes its own time(and it ain't consistent). I personally got frustrated with this unlocking mechanism, I switched to face and pattern recognition. I would have been happy if they had provided capacitive fingerprint scanner. Even after the recent update, it didn't help much, yes, now the rate of successful detection is high but still fails most of the times.To conclude,I was using MI 5(with Sd820) and it lasted for 3 years. I wanted another budget phone which can last 3 years(I don't wanted to buy mi), so went ahead with Samsung, but looking at it's performance i can say it won't last for 3 years. I personally wouldn't recommend buying this phone. Consider all the factors and make your decision, as we will be using it for at least 2-3 years.

I increased the animation speed to 0.5x from developer settings which I usually use.The rear triple camera setup is just okay. You can get 32mp only in one mode and in that too pictures are not very clear. Although the front camera is quite good and can take pictures in portrait mode too. Before this, I was using MIA1 and I feel the rear camera of my 2 year old phone was better than this one. I just hope that the camera improved with future updates as the hardware is very capable and just needs a bit of software tweaks. I've seen in YouTube videos that you can install gcam directly which gives better photos .The battery is just okay and would harely last a day with moderate usage. It give a screen on time of around 4 hrs.For gamers, don't expect very high performance. For smooth running of PUBG, You will have to reduce the graphic settings. I didn't play any other game.The phone does not have an earpiece and instead uses some kind of screen vibration technology to produce sound.The display is just okay and you will face difficulty reading in open.

You may notice this if OLED screen and XR screen.4) Dual Camera - Blur background picture can be taken through Dual Camera, which is missing in XR.As a iphone lover, I have purchase XR and don't want to shed another 27K for above four features so havent purchased XS.This phone was not available in stores in Noida and Delhi but amazon deliver it in 2 days.Kudos to Amazon for timely delivery.

They forced me install app and continue with troubleshooting when they realised that technical team not available at my address. Also, I have already spent 45 mins talking to them on phone and on top of that they want me to install app and work with them to identify problem. Why I should invest a time when bought a new phone . If they don't have technical team to check phone then must cancel my order and initiate refund. Call centre guys was so rude and hang up the call when I was talking. This is really cheap and worst my first experience with Amazon, Amazon business team must get involved here and work on how this replacement gap can be fulfilled. Call centre guys are like handicapped and unable to take decision really they like helpless.

Honor calls its approach FullView, which basically refers to devices with a higher screen-to-device ratio.Honor 9 Lite     ScreenMaking the front of your phone even more about the display than usual places extra pressure on the quality of the screen itself. Thankfully, the Honor 9 Lite isn   t found wanting in this respect.This is a nicely sized 5.65-inch IPS LCD screen, with decent viewing angles, contrast and strong brightness when you need to crank things up. You   d need to spend considerably more money to find something much better. Meanwhile, a 2160 x 1080 (FHD+) resolution ensures that individual pixels can   t be picked out, to the tune of 428ppi.Honor 9 Lite     PerformanceOne of the reasons Honor phones can often appear to offer more features than many of their budget rivals is because they have access to the cheaper processors of HiSilicon, which is owned by parent company Huawei.In the Honor 9 Lite   s case this means the 2.36GHz Kirin 659 CPU, which is the same chip that powers both the Honor 7X and the Huawei P Smart. It   s accompanied by 3GB of RAM, which is 1GB less than the 7X.The Kirin 659 is a lower-mid-range chip that appears to sit in the middle of Qualcomm   s entry-level offerings. An average Geekbench 4 multicore score of 3644 pitches the Honor 9 Lite well below the slightly more expensive Moto G5S Plus (with its Snapdragon 625) on 4460, but well above the similarly priced Moto G5S (packing a Snapdragon 430) on 2294Honor 9 Lite     SoftwareJust like the similarly specced Huawei P Smart, the Honor 9 Lite runs the latest version of Google   s mobile OS, Android 8.0 Oreo. This is a good thing.Honor 9 Lite     CameraRather impressively for a budget phone, Honor has managed to follow the Honor 9 and Honor 7X and equip the Honor 9 Lite with a dual camera setup. In fact, it   s gone one step further and provided a similar provision for selfies.Both the front and rear of the device play host to one 13-megapixel and one 2-megapixel sensor. Just as with the Honor 7X, the smaller secondary sensor is there purely to provide depth information for the included wide aperture and portrait modes.Honor 9 Lite     Battery lifeThe Honor 9 Lite comes with a 3000mAh battery, which is pretty typical for a phone of this size. It   s a little smaller than the 3340mAh battery of the similarly specced Honor 7X, but that phone has a larger and more demanding 6-inch display.Perhaps as a result, Honor claims that you can get an extra hour of offline video watching out of the Honor 9 Lite   s battery (13 hours rather than 12). In practice, we found that it ate through a similar amount of battery (14%) when watching a 50-minute downloaded TV programme with the screen brightness bumped right up, which isn   t great.Why buy the Honor 9 Lite?The Honor 9 Lite offers a number of strong features for a 13,000 price tag. Its all-screen design is something we still aren   t used to seeing at this price point, while general performance is reasonably snappyScore    Performance7    Camera7    Design7    Battery Life6    Value8    Software5    Calls & Sound7    Screen Quality8VerdictThe Honor 9 Lite   s bezel-light design and twin-lens camera tricks are eye catching, but it   s perhaps too quirky to fully take on the Motorola G-series at the top of the table.Honor 9 Lite (3 GB 32 GB) Blue', '0 users found this review helpful'], ['Waste of money...dont buy this phn...mi is much better than this', '0 users found this review helpful'], ['Very nice prodect ..', '0 users found this review helpful'], [""There's no headset in the box"", '0 users found this review helpful'], ['Weight less and good battery back up and speedy....', '0 users found this review helpful'], ['Worst camera..

Now coming to the pros:-1) The Screen Quality is really nice. Also, according to me, it has the strongest build quality (of the screen) as I have dropped the phone many times directly on the screen and nothing happens *Note that I have not applied any Screen Guard or Protection, just it's cover (provided in the box) is enough to keep it safe* ...... So the inclusion on Gorilla Glass 6 will make it 5 to 6 times stronger..!!2) Ram Management of the 6gb ram varient is also the best in its price bracket (compared to RN5 pro and RN6 pro).3) Speaker Quality is             .4) Last but not the least, I have played PUBG continuously for 6hrs and 18mins and still, the battery percentage degraded from 100% to 18%.
