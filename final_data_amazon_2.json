Finally it boiled down to 2 phones that being S10+ and Huawei P30 pro.Finally decided on buying P30 pro as it had better battery.So I bought it.Now the issues(After a few hours of recieving the phone)- Wireless charging- when I placed the phone on my fast wireless charger, it showed charging. Then after 1 hour, no charge at all. Instead it dropped a level!! 16% charge became 15% after an hour. I was little confused. So I changed my charger brick and decided to use the charger given by the company. Same result, no charge.Then I used cable charging with a fast 2.0 (Qualcomm certified) charger. Same result. Negative charging.Now I changed my charging brick to one given by the company. Finally it charged.Then again when the level fell below 18%, tried wireless charging. Same result. No charging/negative charging.I am really confused as to what is wrong??Have called for an engineer from Amazon.Then when he checks for the problem,will order for a replacement.One more thing.

I saw that this phone was not due to be released till the 15th. I couldn't wait, I had ordered it from aliexpress. There were delays in shipping them out so I ordered one from Amazon. I personally don't like Samsung phones. I've been using pixels since they were launched and I was amazed by the low light shots it could take. The huawei phones pretty much flew under the radar and didn't seem much of an upgrade.This phone changed everything.The camera is good, low light shots are incredibly detailed. I can see the freakin moon with the craters (almost) without my telescope (celestron astromaster 130eq Md). The ai scene identification is accurate. Videos are average though.  The camera has tons of modes and a very customizable manual mode.The UI needs a little getting used to from a stock android user perspective.  The voice call quality for both the acoustic display and the microphone are very good.Gaming is a blast, I could game for 3hours of Pubg before the phone needing a recharge. The 4200mah battery and the supercharger make life so much better.The display is fhd plus. You should have no issues playing 4k videos downloaded from anywhere.You can connect the phone to the TV using a USB 3.1 to hdmi adapter and use it as a chromebook. Wireless also works but there is a little bit of latency, which is to be expected. You can also game this way.Overall I'm very very satisfied with the purchase. Its and blind buy. Multi tasking is a breeze.To get most of the battery, use a dark theme and a black wallpaper as this is an AMOLED display.

Honor calls its approach FullView, which basically refers to devices with a higher screen-to-device ratio.Honor 9 Lite     ScreenMaking the front of your phone even more about the display than usual places extra pressure on the quality of the screen itself. Thankfully, the Honor 9 Lite isn   t found wanting in this respect.This is a nicely sized 5.65-inch IPS LCD screen, with decent viewing angles, contrast and strong brightness when you need to crank things up. You   d need to spend considerably more money to find something much better. Meanwhile, a 2160 x 1080 (FHD+) resolution ensures that individual pixels can   t be picked out, to the tune of 428ppi.Honor 9 Lite     PerformanceOne of the reasons Honor phones can often appear to offer more features than many of their budget rivals is because they have access to the cheaper processors of HiSilicon, which is owned by parent company Huawei.In the Honor 9 Lite   s case this means the 2.36GHz Kirin 659 CPU, which is the same chip that powers both the Honor 7X and the Huawei P Smart. It   s accompanied by 3GB of RAM, which is 1GB less than the 7X.The Kirin 659 is a lower-mid-range chip that appears to sit in the middle of Qualcomm   s entry-level offerings. An average Geekbench 4 multicore score of 3644 pitches the Honor 9 Lite well below the slightly more expensive Moto G5S Plus (with its Snapdragon 625) on 4460, but well above the similarly priced Moto G5S (packing a Snapdragon 430) on 2294Honor 9 Lite     SoftwareJust like the similarly specced Huawei P Smart, the Honor 9 Lite runs the latest version of Google   s mobile OS, Android 8.0 Oreo. This is a good thing.Honor 9 Lite     CameraRather impressively for a budget phone, Honor has managed to follow the Honor 9 and Honor 7X and equip the Honor 9 Lite with a dual camera setup. In fact, it   s gone one step further and provided a similar provision for selfies.Both the front and rear of the device play host to one 13-megapixel and one 2-megapixel sensor. Just as with the Honor 7X, the smaller secondary sensor is there purely to provide depth information for the included wide aperture and portrait modes.Honor 9 Lite     Battery lifeThe Honor 9 Lite comes with a 3000mAh battery, which is pretty typical for a phone of this size. It   s a little smaller than the 3340mAh battery of the similarly specced Honor 7X, but that phone has a larger and more demanding 6-inch display.Perhaps as a result, Honor claims that you can get an extra hour of offline video watching out of the Honor 9 Lite   s battery (13 hours rather than 12). In practice, we found that it ate through a similar amount of battery (14%) when watching a 50-minute downloaded TV programme with the screen brightness bumped right up, which isn   t great.Why buy the Honor 9 Lite?The Honor 9 Lite offers a number of strong features for a 13,000 price tag.

Display & Build: probably the biggest highlights of the phone. A metal frame with glass on both sides and a gorgeous display. Honestly the only display which can give AMOLED display a run for it's money.Software: Runs on EMUI 8 based on Android 8 and is scheduled to get EMUI 9 based on Android 9 by June 2019. This is a super feature rich UI and will give u a tonne of feature that do not exist in Stock Android.its very well optimized too. Honestly I like EMUI over a lot of other UIs. It's mature and feature rich. Plus honor has been good with software updates. My pH is running the April Security Patch update.3. Processor : For today's standards the processor is definitely slow. Kirin 659 is almost a Snapdragon 630 equivalent. However u will feel that only if ur a gamer. Daily tasks r a breeze. So gamers stay away from this mobile. Others, PL go ahead and buy it. It's still a very good processor.4. Camera : it's got a superb pair of dual cameras which can click awesome pics is natural lighting and we'll lit artificial lighting conditions. The only place it struggles is low low lighting conditions. But then at this price u can't complaint. Same goes with the selfie cam too.5. Battery: Another con in the pH is it's battery. It's not pathetic, but definitely not for heavy users. It will easily last 1 working day for moderate users,but heavy users will have to top it up again in the evening and unfortunately no fast charging is supported. In fact takes quite a bit of time to charge.Verdict : go buy this pH if ur looking for an awesome looking devices with feature UI, good build, good cameras and a decent processor with decent battery life.Heavy users and gamers, stay away.

So, no complaint in that department. I know its a bit early to write a review, but believe me, I spent a month to decide between One Plus 7 and Asus 6z. \n\nSo let's get started. It's going to be a bit lengthy so please have patience.\n\nThose who are looking for a short answer - Just go for it without a second thought (but be careful).\n\nIf you are reading this then the chances are you might be confused between one plus 7 and 6z. Let me just fractionize the pros and cons with details.\n\nWhy I chose this device over OP7.\n\n1. Better battery backup.\n2. The secondary camera in OP7 is a depth sensor on the other hand 6z has a wide-angle aperture.\n3. Infinity Display (not everyone's choice).\n4. Durability (It survived many drop tests against OP7).\n5. Your main camera is your selfie camera (so great clarity).\n\nPros.\n\n1. Great Camera, hands down to that. Low light photos have some grains but much better than OP7.\n2. I was a bit skeptical about the flip camera but since it is made with the liquid metal it's more durable than you think.\n3. Infinite Display.\n4. Powered by snapdragon 855 offering awesome speed and smoothness.\n5. Navigation is superb just love the smoothness.\n6. Even though it runs on zen UI 6, you will not see any bloatware like Mi (I hate MiUI). Stock android like feeling with some additional features. \n7. GPU is Adreno 640, making games like PUBG and COD buttery-smooth (back might get warm after a while but it's common with every device, even with Samsung S10 and iPhone 11).\n7.  HDR 10 + (will speak about this in the latter part).\n8. The front is protected with Gorilla glass 6 and back with Gorilla Glass 3.\n9. Customizable function button (I am using it for torch).\n10. 600 Nits of luminosity (in simple terms awesome daylight readability). FYI, iPhone 11 has 610 Nits.\n11. Massive battery 5000 mAh. (Now it might look like your battery is draining fast but with moderate use, it will last for a day and a half.). To conserve more battery you have to stop playing around with the flip camera as it runs on a motor and motor consumes a lot of power.\n12. Plus point, a headphone jack with and high res earphone. (By the way, a good High res earphone comes around 2k).\n13. Awesome sound especially through earphones. Now I am Dolby Atmos guy and I had my doubts with DTS X, but it turned out to be amazing.\n14. Dedicated memory slot expandable up to 2 TB.\n15. Physical fingerprint sensor (I trust this more than in display).\n\nNow the cons.\n\n1. Its IPS LCD and not AMOLED (Now this has HDR 10+ which means the colors and display is as good as Amoled, plus no dead pixels like AMOLED. I think that's why Apple is sticking with LCD's).\n2. No in-display fingerprint (for some people it is a con).\n3. No  IP rating (but can handle some splashes).\n4. Even though Asus claims it has stereo speakers but the earpiece acting as a secondary speaker is not as good as OP7. It's more muffled and too low.\n5. Bit heavy and bulky 201g to be precise (but fits really well in hand).\n6. No depth sensor (Hey, what else you need in 28k).\n7. No pre-applied screen protection (But GG6).\n8. Since its flip camera, you can't take selfies while the phone is on a flat surface. But the camera is auto-retractable if it experiences some hurdle.\n\nNow you might ask Nikhil if the pros look like pros and the cons look like pros; what's the problem, why 3 star?\n\nNot everything with the device is roses and rainbows.\n\nThis device has a problem (not every device but mine has). I first noticed this on the second day, when I kept my phone to charge. The device rebooted itself and I wasn't even using it. At first, I thought it might be a glitch because not every device is perfect. Then the same thing happened again when I was scrolling through Instagram. The screen froze and restarted. \n\nYesterday  I was in my office and the phone was beside me, again the same thing happened, an auto reboot. Then I thought this thing is serious and I googled about the same and came to know that I am not the only one who is facing this issue. Even the negative reviews over here are filled with the same. When I spoke with ASUS representative he told me that this is a hardware issue and I have to go for a replacement.\n\nBefore that, I thought its just a glitch and can easily be resolved with an OTA update but things went south. Sadly you can't tell whether your device is faulty or not but you can run few tests to determine the same.\n\n1. Play high-end games like PUBG or COD for at least 60 minutes.\n2. Or download the Antutu app from playstore and do a stress test.\n\nIf any these test fails or your system restarts then it's faulty. As of now, my device is under the return process but it's a bit hard over here. They rejected the request 2 times. Has a window till 7 Nov.

This is my 3rd asus phone. I really like asus phones because of thier features they bringing each time on thier new phones. This time obviously the flip camera. Definitely redefining ordinary phones. After a long wait finally i got this phone in 26000rs during this big billion days. :)\nA quick comparison with new one plus 7 is - it don't have that liquid cooling feature which is somewhat helpful if you are a big game lover. I played pubg in this phone, it's heating little bit. But not like hot pan like heat. And not completely water resistant like oneplus. Other than this i didn't feel any other major draw backs when compared with oneplus. But have more common features like radio, microphone jack etc.\nCamera is really good. Low light photos could have been little more better. May be with upcomming update s this may solve. Battery life is really good. Fast charging is really helpfull to fill this 5000mah massive battery very quickly. \nThe main missing factor in this phone when i compare with my zenphone 3 is Asus's kids mode. That was really helpful for parent like me. And adaptive sensor need some adjustments which also required some improvement and it's little heavy because of that massive battery. If you are watching movies by holding in your hand, you may feel pain. But again it's not a big issue. My Zenfone 3 was so light.\nOther than these this is really a super nice solid phone guys. With lot of other Asus's good customized features and this time they brought near stock android ui. That's also awesome. Asus's customized features and Google features made this phone really incredible.\n Don't under estimate asus.

The choice was to be made between this and the similarly priced Oneplus 7, but I chose the 6z for the features it was offering at the same price point. The main thing that turned me off from me purchasing was the fact the Oneplus 7 missed the headphone jack and I am not really a fan of Bluetooth headsets. So, I decided to buy this device in the flash sale that took place. \n\nMy initial impressions regarding that device were rather good. I was drawn into the flip camera the most since it really offered some cool ways in which one could make use of the mobile camera. The performance of the device was also pretty neat with all the games running smoothly. But after 2 months of the purchase, the device started to behave abruptly. It started restarting on its own randomly and sometimes it turns itself off and won't start. After an hour or so I tried again to boot the device and I was successful this time which left me a bit confused on why didn't start earlier. On researching in the Asus forums, I found out that it was not only me who was facing this issue but a bunch of other people were also facing the same issue, which supposedly is related to some hardware problem. \n\nHighly disappointed by Asus, that such a reputed company can come out with a flagship having hardware problems.

I recorded the restarts/crashes through other phone as proof. I requested replacement in haste as I had heard the restart/crash issue with this phone before buying but without any resolution mentioned anywhere. Flipkart supported me & from Asus/Seller side third party agent was sent to inspect the phone. As expected phone behaved normally during inspection/restart. The agent left saying he saw some issues & assuring case will be forwarded. He however gave clean cheat & I received message from seller stating my replacement request cannot be processed. Annoyed I made few calls to Flipkart ,where representatives helped me again to take up the case. Again Seller sent 2nd agent for inspection. This agent also did not find issue but found another upgrade was just available on my phone. He just upgraded the phone. He did not note any issue in phone as expected again. I had already found 2 upgraded earlier & I completed them but still issue persisted. After this upgrade the crashes/restart stopped.

I'm a pure Android fan. Never appreciated the bloatware that many manufacturers include with phones. Hence it was very easy for me to go ahead with this purchase. This phone is for those like me who understand you can't have everything by paying nothing; You need to compromise somewhere. I use phones mostly for Calls, Messages, WhatsApp, Online Shopping, Travel Bookings, YouTube, Netflix, Hotstar and other OTT Apps. Not a photography enthusiast, So camera is not a priority to me. \n\nAnd I'm into PC Gaming more than mobile so even this doesn't matter to me. If you're a serious mobile gamer, Consider phones with better CPU; Like Poco F1 which has a Snapdragon 800 Series at a great price point. If not, XiaoMi RedMi K20, Blackshark 2, OnePlus, ASUS ROG, Nubia RedMagic etc.,\n\nI'm rating 5 stars since there aren't many pure Android phones at this price point excluding XiaoMi A3. It was a tough call to pick this over A3, But the FHD+ display on the G8 Plus was the sole reason. If you don't prefer a Motorola then XiaoMi A3 is a good phone to consider.

", "14 users found this review helpful"]]}{"rating": "4.2", "based_on": "9,597", "reviews,useful": [["I'm writing this review after using Motorola One Action extensively for last 10days. \nPROS:\n1)Android One device with 128gb storage under 15K-This is the biggest plus for this device.\n2) Phone is very slim in width so one handed operation is very easy.\n3)Camera-In camera department, it can shot RAW images in manual mode! picture quality is not the best in the market but most of the users are generally casual users, so it'll not be a problem for uploading it social media. Action camera is not tested enough to give a review. Though photos can't be clicked using Wide angle camera but while using it for taking video you can use the option of screenshot button to click photos. \n4) Performance is fast and smooth enough for doing all the day to day works.\n5) USB type-c port, it's pretty useful these days.\n6) Speaker is at the bottom and decent enough.\nNEUTRALS:-\n1)21:9 aspect ratio-it looks good when you play a supportive video but most of the time you'll find it useless bcoz maximum videos are not available in this aspect ratio including YT, Hotstar, Prime Video etc.\n2) Hardware- Backside is glossy plastic and it can't be used without the silicon cover provided with it or any other similar back over.\nCONS:-\n1)Battery backup is woefully low in comparison with any other similar device.. atleast 4000mAH battery is basic. If you are staying outdoor for long hours you have to keep powerbank with you. Also the charger provided with the phone is a slow charger not a turbo or fast charger, it take ages to charge the device specially if you are in a hurry.\n2) Display is the second most disappointing issue in this phone. You have to increase the brightness to atleast 40% -50% to be able to see anything in daylight. Also normal 15% 20% brightness is pretty dark and not suitable for watching movies or anything unlike other similar devices.\n3)Big round notch in the front screen for front camera looks very very ugly. it should have been much smaller. Due to this notch it's very hard to get a proper tampered glass for this phone.\n4) Gaming is not much tested in this phone but from whatever I played (NOT PUBG) though it handled well but device gets very hot in short period of time also you have to keep the graphics to low/medium for best results. So if you are planning to play Pubg look for other device not this one. Also the big camera notch is very problematic while gaming.\n5)Very difficult to reach contents which are in top of the screen as most of the time top notification bar will come down.\nFINAL WORD:\nIf you have budget of less than 15K and not an avid gamer this phone is made for you. Not only it has Google's Android One version also 128gb storage device under 15K is impossible to find. With few cons I'll still recommend this device just for the price.\nPlease give a like if you find this helpful! Thank you!", "21 users found this review helpful"], ["Searching over the last one day on the internet, I found myself very impressed by this one. I placed an order and It took me three days to receive. I'm writing this review after one and half day of use. I'm listing out the Pros and Cons of Motorola One Action that will helps you out for making choice:-\n\nPros:-\n1. 1080x2520 Screen Ratio, Full HD+ display and Dolby Sound takes you to the next level of watching movies or songs.\n\n2. Video shooting with ultra vide camera is like a in build Go-Pro camera in your phone.\n\n3. Android 9 Pie is very user-friendly and keeps you faster while ,Android One keeps you always updated before everyone else. Android also promised for Android ver 10&11 can be updated to this device.\n\n4. 4GB Ram & 128GB inbuild Storage capacity not needs to tell.\n\n5. 2.2GHz Octa Core Samsung Exynos 9609 processor is performing so well.\n\n6. I got this on Rs. 13,999/- on special offer.\n\nCons:-\n1. No turbo charging facility but still a good battery life. will not recommend to PUBG users.\n\n2. Front Camera Black Dot circle little bit highlighted for their size. but still manageble.\n\n3. Temper Glass not available in the market at the moment, you have to buy it online as of 14 Sep 19.\n\n4. Only launched in two colors but Denim Blue is still a killer one.\n\nConclusion:-\n\nI would strongly recommend to those users who like Motorola Brand because the facilities provided by Moto in this range is truly value for money. You can still find much more better specifications to other mobile phones bundle up in plastic cases but this one is brand Motorola. So I suggest end your search here and buy it immediately.\n\nThanks", "14 users found this review helpful"], ["Phone looks really stunning in the 21:9 Display. Viewing angles are good.

I love it.", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["I am addicted to sony brand,since 8 years I use only Sony mobiles,that too only  highend mobiles of Sony,for the first time Sony disappointed me....Buyed two Sony Xperia z5 duos mobiles in another site not in amazon, in both phones the basic feature gyroscope gone faulty, gyroscope failured, not worked, so returned both mobiles in just two days of use.,it's a major flaw in z5 series,came from z3 and again gone back to z3, z3 the best ever model in z series, I suggest not to buy z5 series mobiles,better buy z3 if u are a Sony lover.", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["Best Smartphone of Sony", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["Dealing was excellent", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["This is one of the best mobile...

You could have provided a better battery for a phone like this.. at least 4000mah..", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["Very good phone. Display is very sharp. Initially some heating issues were there but after few days it is good. Earlier purchased one plus two but that device was a small heater. Thanks to Sony.  Battery is also better than other similar capacity phones. Though price is quite high but brand matters bhai.", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["This is the only dual-SIM flagship smartphone from any mobile phone manufacturer. A dual-SIM is of vital importance to us Indians - one SIM is for personal use and the other for official use. So it makes a lot of sense to carry around one phone (It may be a problem if it gets stolen - you lose both SIMS, but then, conversely, it is easier to look after a single phone rather than juggle around two phones).\n\nUnlike its predecessors, the Xperia Z5 has no heating issues. It is sleek, well balanced and very ergonomic. The user interface is very simple and familiar to SONY mobile fans. The price has come down considerably now.\n\nThe Xperia logo on the side adds a lot of class. The start/stop oblong button incorporates the fingerprint sensor and it works beautifully. The sensitivity is amazing - loads better than Samsung.\n\nThe 23 MP camera is top top-class, rivaling DSLR cameras.\n\nThe display is brilliant showing natural colours, unlike the augmented and saturated colours on the Samsung Edge.\n\nEasily the best phone in India.", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["Almost everything about this phone is perfect -- great design- great screen- great battery backup- during video playback, battery consumption is fast, but at other times, battery is just amazing- good multitasking- great audio quality- great cameras in daylight- low light photography isn't upto flagship standards but still good- stereo speakers quality is amazing but the maximum volume isn't too high (sufficient for personal use)Overall a balanced phone. Recommended.", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["Best phone. The S6 may have better specs but the firmware isn't optimised. (Just search for RAM management on Samsung). This phone has awesome battery, camera (accurate colours, unlike Samsung where it is oversaturated), and is waterproof.", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["Osm phone, the phone is a beauty and beast\nBut does heat up a bit. Battery actually drains a bit faster when you keep on playing a game or use your camera.\nFor normal usage the different battery mode will pretty much extend it for close to two days.\nThe offers are really great, but no idea how to redeem the free ebooks, if anyone figured it out please ping me in on the details.\nBut that aside the phone performance is great it seems like virtually it can handle anything.\nAnd the most important from my perspective multitasking is fantastic.\nAnd if you smart enough you can get the mobile for 45k.\nHope you guys find this useful.", "0 users found this review helpful"], ["Amazing on amazon.in", "0 users found this review helpful"]]}
